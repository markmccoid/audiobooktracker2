Nightingale was named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, one of Book magazine's best novels of the year, and one of School Library Journal's Best Adult Books for High School Readers. In this second tale, we return to the story of Takeo (the young orphan taken up by the Otori Lord and now a closely held member of the Tribe) and his beloved Shirakawa Kaede, heir to the Maruyama, who must find a way to unify the domain she has inherited. In a complex social hierarchy, amid dissembling clans and fractured alliances, there is no place for passionate love. Yet Takeo and Kaede, drawing on their unusual talents and hidden strengths, find ways both to nurture their intense personal bond and to honor the best interests of their people. Like its predecessor, Grass for His Pillow is a transcendent work of storytelling: epic in scope, shimmering with imagination, and graced in equal measure with rapturous writing and exhilarating action.","author":"Lian Hearn","authors":["Lian Hearn"],"narratedBy":"Kevin Gray ","publishedYear":2003,"releaseDate":"2004-06-01","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"9:25:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51paVky3mNL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Classics","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B002V5CMTO"},{"id":"audible-Lemony_Snicket~Interview_with_Lemony_Snicket_(a.k.a._Daniel_Handler)~863","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Interview with Lemony Snicket (a.k.a.

The Emperor of All Maladies reveals the many faces of an iconic, shape-shifting disease that is the defining plague of our generation. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance but also of hubris, arrogance, paternalism, and misperception, all leveraged against a disease that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out \"war against cancer\". Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary. The audiobook is like a literary thriller with cancer as the central character.  From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast, to the 19th-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee's own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through toxic, bruising, and draining regimens in order to survive - and to increase the store of human knowledge.

In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed and, over a 10-year period, sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then, one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now, in Loving What Is, you can discover the same freedom through The Work.  The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, \"It's not the problem that causes our suffering; it's our thinking about the problem.\" Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point we can truly love what is, just as it is.  Loving What Is will show you step by step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You'll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work's power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible.  If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process and to find happiness as what Katie calls \"a lover of reality\".

This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For listeners of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories?

The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed best seller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly. In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:  The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service  In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.","author":"Dan Heath","authors":["Chip Heath","Dan Heath"],"narratedBy":"Charles Kahlenberg","publishedYear":2010,"releaseDate":"2010-02-16","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"7:43:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51af4LVf08L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B0035C6SMO"},{"id":"audible-Cyril_Robinson~A_History_of_Rome~75","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A History of Rome","author":"Cyril Robinson","authors":["Cyril Edward Robinson"],"narratedBy":"Charlton Griffin","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"1946","pageCount":540,"bookLength":"18:42:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51so1vixABL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["History - Military","Rome"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","description":"A History of Rome is the story of a tiny market town on the Tiber, its rise to world domination, and then its slow, terrible plunge to utter ruin. The rise and fall of Rome is the most thrilling event in world history. And in the hands of master historian Cyril Robinson we hear the narrative of this incredible story in unsurpassed, brilliant, and eloquent language. Discover the fascinating origin of Rome and its mysterious Etruscan connections, its first faltering steps toward republican government in the 8th century B.C., and its methodical subjugation of surrounding tribes.  Slowly, the puritanical Roman Republic asserts control over all of Italy and in the process forges a political unity which proves enduring. That unity is sorely tested as Rome comes into conflict with Carthage and Hannibal, a horrifying ordeal which alters world history for all time. A resurgent Rome is next drawn into the intrigues of the eastern Mediterranean, finally conquering the Greek speaking world...only to end up surrendering itself to a seductive, decadent Hellenistic culture.  A century of political tension and civil strife ensues. Follow the rise of powerful men like the brothers Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Cicero and the greatest Roman of them all Julius Caesar. With Caesar's assassination comes renewed civil war. The aristocratic senatorial faction is defeated and the Republican form of government is replaced by dictatorship. Caesar's adopted nephew, Augustus, comes to power as the first Roman Emperor and puts into place the most extraordinary experiment in imperial government ever attempted. In the process, he paves the way for a long period of peace a golden age the likes of which has never before been seen since.  The Empire is ruled by one dynasty after another some good, some bad until it reaches its apogee during the age of the brilliant Antonine emperors. But chaos follows with a series of corrupt rulers, and only the strong leadership of Diocletion late in the 3rd century A.D. brings stability. Shortly afterward, Constantine's rule promotes the new faith of Christianity and makes it the official religion of the empire.  But the downward spiral of decay cannot be reversed. Economic disruptions, plague and barbarian invasions prove too much for Rome, and the western half of the empire descends into a maelstrom of ignorance, despair and random violence from which it will not emerge for many centuries.

If we can conquer outer space, we can conquer inner space, too.  Christopher Reeve has mastered the art of turning the impossible into the inevitable. In Nothing Is Impossible, Reeve shows that we are all capable of overcoming seemingly insurmountable hardships. He interweaves anecdotes from his own life with excerpts from speeches and interviews he's given.  Reeve teaches us that for able-bodied people, paralysis is a choice - a choice to live with self-doubt and a fear of taking risks - and that it is not an acceptable one. Reeve knows from experience that the work of conquering inner space is hard and that it requires some suffering - after all, nothing worth having is easy to get. He asks challenging questions about why it seems so difficult - if not impossible - for us to work together as a society. He steers the reader gently, offering his reflections and guidance but not the pat answers that often characterize inspirational works.  Published on the eve of both his fiftieth birthday and the seventh anniversary of his spinal cord injury, Christopher Reeve's Nothing Is Impossible reminds us that life is not to be taken for granted but to be lived fully with zeal, curiosity, and gratitude. That is a powerful message in itself, but it is the messenger who gives it its full resonance.

It is written on three separate levels by Scott Adams, better known as the creator of the Dilbert comic. What is less known about Adams is that he's a trained hypnotist. God's Debris is what happens when creativity and hypnosis intersect. On the surface, God's Debris is a simple fictional story of a delivery man who encounters an Avatar who knows literally everything. The Avatar reveals the truth about God, reality, science, probability, human perception, and even social success. Adams uses a writing trick to make the Avatar's answers appear more persuasive than they should be. The second level of the book involves arguing with your friends about what parts the Avatar got wrong. Some of what the Avatar says is consistent with science, and some of it is pure fiction. See if you can tell which is which. You and your friends will come to very different conclusions.The third level of the book is the most provocative, but it won't have the same effect on all listeners. The story is designed as a very subtle hypnotic induction, with the intent of giving some (but not all) listeners the sensation that the Avatar's words actually contain the wisdom of the universe.  For some listeners, especially those under 30, God's Debris can be a mind altering experience. Fair Warning: Because of the hypnotic writing style, listeners tend to have strong reactions to the work. If you are in the top 5% of the population in terms of scientific knowledge, or philosophical reading, there's a good chance you will have an angry reaction to God's Debris. But if you are more of a seeker than a know-it-all, your experience could be something special.","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BMUTF7sJL._SL500_.jpg","asin":"B002V0QKA6"},{"id":"audible-David_Bodanis~E=mc2~898","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"E=mc2","description":"Generations have grown up knowing that the equation E=mc2 changed the shape of our world, but never understanding what it actually means and why it was so significant.

Fifteen years after his number one New York Times best seller, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, Deepak Chopra revisits \"the forgotten miracle\" – the body's infinite capacity for change and renewal. You cannot take advantage of this miracle, Chopra says, unless you are willing to completely reinvent your body, transforming it from a material object to a dynamic, flowing process. \"Your physical body is a fiction,\" Chopra contends. Every cell is made up of two invisible ingredients: awareness and energy. Transformation can't stop with the body, however; it must involve the soul. The soul – seemingly invisible, aloof, and apart from the material world – actually creates the body. Only by going to the level of the soul will you access your full potential, bringing more intelligence, creativity, and awareness into every aspect of your life. Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul delivers ten breakthroughs – five for the body, five for the soul – that lead to self-transformation. In clear, accessible terms, Chopra shows us how to commit ourselves to deeper awareness, focus on relationships instead of consumption, embrace every day as a new world, and transcend the obstacles that afflict body and mind. Deepak Chopra has inspired millions with his profound teachings over the years. His best-selling books have explored the mind/body connection and the power of spirit. With his latest book, he invites you to experience with him the miracles that unfold when we connect the body directly to the awesome mysteries that give life meaning – directly to the soul.

By gaining access to this wellspring of creation, we can literally rewrite our destinies in any way we wish.  From this realm of pure potential we are connected to everything that exists and everything that is yet to come. \"Coincidences\" can then be recognized as containing precious clues about particular facets of our lives that require our attention.

For centuries, electricity was seen as little more than a curious property of certain substances that sparked when rubbed. Then, in the 1790s, Alessandro Volta began the scientific investigation that ignited an explosion of knowledge and invention. The force that once seemed inconsequential was revealed to be responsible for everything from the structure of the atom to the functioning of our brains. In harnessing its power, we have created a world of wonders - complete with roller coasters and radar, computer networks and psychopharmaceuticals.  In Electric Universe, the great discoverers come to life in all their brilliance and idiosyncrasy, including the visionary Michael Faraday, who struggled against the prejudices of the British class system, and Samuel Morse, a painter who, before inventing the telegraph, ran for mayor of New York City on a platform of persecuting Catholics. Here too is Alan Turing, whose dream of a marvelous thinking machine - what we know as the computer - was met with indifference, and who ended his life in despair after British authorities forced him to undergo experimental treatments to “cure” his homosexuality.  From the frigid waters of the Atlantic to the streets of Hamburg during a World War II firestorm to the interior of the human body, Electric Universe is a mesmerizing journey of discovery. ","author":"David Bodanis","authors":["David Bodanis"],"narratedBy":"Del Roy","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2006-02-28","publisher":"Crown","pageCount":322,"bookLength":"6:38:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RE1sODEEL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Physics","Science"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Science","asin":"B002V0M0NC"},{"id":"audible-Ken_Wilber~The_Marriage_of_Sense_and_Soul~605","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Marriage of Sense and Soul","description":"Science and religion have always been considered mutually exclusive concepts, but are they really?

Wilber shows that not only is science compatible with the world's religions, it is indeed necessary to unite the two. He presents an elegant and accessible program which is breathtaking in its scope - one that cannot fail to change the way you look at your world.","author":"Ken Wilber","authors":["Ken Wilber"],"narratedBy":"Denis deBoisblanc","publishedYear":2000,"releaseDate":"2011-08-03","publisher":"Random House","pageCount":224,"bookLength":"7:21:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uKNzZO+3L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - History & Philosophy - History","Science"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"B002V0M2DK"},{"id":"audible-Roy_Baumeister~Willpower~805","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Willpower","description":"One of the world's most esteemed and influential psychologists, Roy F.

Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one.  In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly are, which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we are, and learn to live and breathe freely.","author":"Eckhart Tolle","authors":["Eckhart Tolle"],"narratedBy":"Eckhart Tolle","publishedYear":2004,"releaseDate":"2006","publisher":"Penguin Life","pageCount":338,"bookLength":"9:12:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51myk5+cdPL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B002V0RAUU"},{"id":"audible-Eckhart_Tolle~Even_the_Sun_Will_Die~813","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Even the Sun Will Die","description":"When Eckhart Tolle agreed to be interviewed on September 11, 2001, he could not foresee the historic nature of this date or the suffering that would follow.

Even the Sun Will Die documents this historic meeting with Eckhart Tolle and the comforting wisdom he revealed that day. \"We live in a time,\" he says, \"when we define ourselves through our enemies; and science and technology are in the service of human madness. Yet even in the face of disaster, a miracle happens when we say 'yes' to living in this moment and no other.\" This \"great opening,\" he teaches, can serve as nothing less than the beginning of a revolution in human consciousness with the potential to transform our world and everyone in it. Also for the first time on audio, Eckhart Tolle comments on his own awakening, and what he sees as the next step in human evolution.

But this amazing and hopeful audiobook shows us that it is not only possible for us to control our brains but also for us to rewire them.  In late 2004, the Mind and Life Institute brought Western Scientists together with the Dalai Lama and other distinguished Buddhist masters to discuss the cutting edge research being conducted in neuroplasticity, which examines whether neurons can be changed and even grown.  The findings are as astonishing as they are helpful. Flying in the face of previous assumptions, the current research shows that not only is it possible for us to change the physical brain, but it is within reach of every single one of us.  Through research into neuroplasticity, it has been shown that we can:  Reset our happiness meter Heal from depression, even major episodes Learn new skills even in old age Learn, and even teach, compassion, a critical finding for personal happiness and a more peaceful world Surprising, encouraging, and full of good news that we all want to hear, Change Your Mind, Change Your Brain will help us not only to change our brains but also the way we approach our lives - for the better.","author":"Sharon Begley","authors":["Sharon Begley"],"narratedBy":"Eliza Foss","publishedYear":2007,"releaseDate":"2007-11-20","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":306,"bookLength":"6:27:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VSe33Sb8L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development","Psychology"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Self Help","asin":"B002V0139Y"},{"id":"audible-Randy_Pausch~The_Last_Lecture~651","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Last Lecture","description":"\"We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.\" ( Randy Pausch) A lot of professors give talks entitled \"The Last Lecture\". Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them. And while they speak, audiences can't help but mull the same question: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy? When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave - \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\" - wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because \"time is all you have...and you may find one day that you have less than you think\"). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living. In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humor, inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.

Objects may be in two places at once. Simply looking at an event can alter it instantaneously.\"  Quantum physics is an astounding (and mind-boggling) field of science, but can you actually use it to change your life? Absolutely yes, says Dr. Quantum. On A User's Guide to Your Universe, Dr. Quantum, who goes by day as mild-mannered physicist Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, teaches that anyone can understand quantum physics. What's more, it is the most useful, immediate, and relevant kind of science you can learn to profoundly affect your day-to-day life.  Your Mind is a Quantum Engine. Are You Ready to Fire It Up? The art of \"applied quantum physics\" is learning how to harness the power of consciousness as we move through space and time. At the heart of quantum theory lies an astonishing (and scientifically proven) truth: that the very act of observing events in your life can alter their outcome. Our minds may not be just along for the ride in an impersonal universe, suggests Dr. Wolf. Instead, we can define the fabric of reality at a fundamental level with the choices we make, the things we choose to see or not see, and most importantly, our intentions in each moment.  Prepare to Unlock Your Own Quantum Superpowers. How does the energy of your emotions change the physical state of your body? Can we actually perceive parallel universes? Is time travel possible for you at this very moment? Dr. Wolf takes you outside the walls of the laboratory, through the pages of history, and into the land of dreams, alchemy, and enchantment. With him, you will follow in the footsteps of such physics giants as Planck, Heisenberg, and Einstein, as you learn to reframe your perceptions of \"ordinary\" reality. Ultimately, you will learn to use the \"Technology of God\", harnessing the power of your mind to become an active co-creator of the universe.","author":"Fred Alan Wolf","authors":["Fred Alan Wolf"],"narratedBy":"Fred Alan Wolf","publishedYear":2006,"releaseDate":"1996","publisher":"Pocket Books","pageCount":376,"bookLength":"7:29:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616KuTG+n3L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Physics","Philosophy"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Science","asin":"B002VACM7Q"},{"id":"audible-Fred_Alan_Wolf~Dr._Quantum_Presents_Meet_the_Real_Creator_-_You!~472","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Dr. Quantum Presents Meet the Real Creator - You!","description":"The more you learn about quantum physics, the more you wonder: who is really creating your reality?

North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world. Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Asriel could want. But what Lyra doesn't know is that to help one of them will be to betray the other....

What kind of life should we lead? What paths lead to happiness? From the ancient philosophers to cutting edge scientists, Haidt weaves a tapestry of the best and the brightest.

For the reader who seeks to understand happiness, my advice is: Begin with Haidt.\" (Martin E.P.

Every prophet, every true saint or enlightened master, every illumined manuscript (from the East to the West) points to this one all-encompassing principle as being the secret gateway to the greater life: the eternally perfect now.The now is the gateway to creativity. It is the home of peace and is where love lives. If we are to answer the call within us to perfect ourselves and the world around us, then we must all take a mandatory step in our own inner-evolution: we must learn to live in (and participate with) the ever-unfolding and ever-new present moment.Here's the problem: we weren't born knowing how to live in the now. Once we outgrow the simple joy of being a small child, we forget what real joy is. Our parents couldn't tell us how to regain that precious power, because they too had fallen asleep to its presence in them. And we were never taught about it in school. Being conscious of ourselves in the present moment is the key to all things good. Our relationships grow, because we do; confidence increases, because we make fewer mistakes in our awakened state. Being grounded in the present moment empowers us to stand in a world where the waves of troubled thoughts and feelings can no longer wash us away.The unique ideas and insights described in Let Go and Live in the Now can literally be put to use the moment you hear them!","author":"Guy Finley","authors":["Guy Finley"],"narratedBy":"Guy Finley","publishedYear":2007,"releaseDate":"2010-09-08","publisher":"Llewellyn Worldwide","pageCount":312,"bookLength":"16:00:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41SrV5zE5EL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B002V8MIJK"},{"id":"audible-Amir_D._Aczel~Entanglement~446","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Entanglement","description":"Will \"beam me up, Scotty\" become reality? Quantum mechanics suggests it may...and soon. Since cyberspace - a word coined by a science fiction writer - became reality, the lines between \"science\" and \"science fiction\" have become increasingly blurred. Now, the young field of quantum mechanics holds out the promise that some of humanity's wildest dreams may be realized. Serious scientists, working off of theories first developed by Einstein and his colleagues 70 years ago, have been investigating the phenomenon known as \"entanglement,\" one of the strangest aspects of the strange universe of quantum mechanics. According to Einstein, quantum mechanics required entanglement - the idea that subatomic particles could become inextricably linked, and that a change to one such particle would instantly be reflected in its counterpart, even if a universe separated them. Einstein felt that if the quantum theory could produce such incredibly bizarre effects, then it had to be invalid. But new experiments both in the United States and Europe show not only that it does happen, but that it may lead to unbreakable codes, and even teleportation... Entanglement is also available in print from Four Walls Eight Windows.","author":"Amir D. Aczel","authors":["Amir D.

He delivers its lyrical style with energy and complete believability.... Definitely not a Disney movie, this is a realistic, heart-thumping account, which Adam delivers with verve, intelligence, and sensitivity. More than a fable, often humorous, always compelling, this tale is infused with the wonder of a teenage boy who finds himself in an unimaginable situation for 227 days. Must listening! Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award, 2019 Audies Finalist.\" (AudioFile magazine)  Winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize for Fiction  Pi Patel is an unusual boy. The son of a zookeeper, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior and a fervent love of stories and practices not only his native Hinduism but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is 16, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450 pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them \"the truth\". After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional - but is it more true?  Life of Pi is at once a realistic, rousing adventure and a meta-tale of survival that explores the redemptive power of storytelling and the transformative nature of fiction. It's a story, as one character puts it, to make you believe in God.  Cover design by Vaugh Andrews.

The concepts offered here relate to the topic of abundance and prosperity. They will show you that you truly need to think about what you want in your life and not what you don't want. If you put your attention on thoughts of not having enough money, you are in the perfect position for the creating of more of that which you do not have. For example, when you think about something that you desire but then think about it not yet coming...and then you think about how much fun it will be to have it, but then remember that it costs a great deal of money and you cannot yet afford it...that back-and-forth thinking dilutes your passion and slows the power of your thoughts. That is, the way you are feeling is a signal from your Inner Being telling you that what you're thinking is not in harmony with what you want. As Abraham says: \"There is enough for everyone.

No matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to stay out of trouble. But can he really be expected to stand by and watch while a bully picks on his scrawny best friend? Or not defend himself against his pre-algebra teacher when she turns into a monster and tries to kill him? Of course, no one believes Percy about the monster incident; he's not even sure he believes himself. Until the Minotaur chases him to summer camp. Suddenly, mythical creatures seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. The gods of Mount Olympus, he's coming to realize, are very much alive in the 21st-century. And worse, he's angered a few of them: Zeus's master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Now Percy has just 10 days to find and return Zeus's stolen property, and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. On a daring road trip from their summer camp in New York to the gates of the Underworld in Los Angeles, Percy and his friends, one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena, will face a host of enemies determined to stop them. To succeed in his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of failure and betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.","author":"Rick Riordan","authors":["Rick Riordan"],"narratedBy":"Jesse Bernstein","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2015","pageCount":375,"bookLength":"10:02:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519VZxUwSHL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Children's Audiobooks - Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy & Magic - Action & Adventure","Betrayal"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense","asin":"B002V0JZOO"},{"id":"audible-Michael_Lewis~The_Big_Short~119","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Big Short","description":"Featuring an exclusive audio interview with Michael Lewis When the crash of the U.S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real-estate derivative markets, where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking. The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real-estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his number-one best-selling Liar’s Poker. \"Who got it right?\" he asks. Who saw the ever-rising real-estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely—really unlikely—heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier best sellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.","author":"Michael Lewis","authors":["Michael Lewis"],"narratedBy":"Jesse Boggs","publishedYear":2010,"releaseDate":"2015-11-16","publisher":"W.

Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, Ruiz shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships. In the Toltec tradition, three fundamental masteries guide us to our true nature, which is happiness, freedom, and love. The first is the Mastery of Awareness. This mastery teaches us to be aware of what we really are. It is the first step toward freedom because we cannot be free if we don't know what we are, or what kind of freedom we are looking for. The Toltecs said, \"Let us see ourselves with truth\", and they created a mastery just for awareness. The second is the Mastery of Transformation, which teaches us how to become spiritual warriors and stalk our actions and reactions so we can break free of the knowledge that enslaves us. This mastery shows us how to change the dream of our life by changing our agreements and beliefs. The Mastery of Love is the result of the first two masteries. From the Toltec perspective, everything is made of Love. Love is Life itself. When we master Love, we align with the Spirit of Life passing through us. We are no longer the body, or the mind, or the soul; we are Love. Then every action we take is an expression of Love, and Love in action can only produce happiness. When we master Awareness, Transformation, and Love, we reclaim our divinity and become one with God. This is the goal of the Toltec.","author":"don Miguel Ruiz","authors":["Don Miguel Ruiz"],"narratedBy":"Jill Eikenberry ","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2003-08","pageCount":48,"bookLength":"2:33:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SuSUWjfML._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B002V0QWQI"},{"id":"audible-Norman_Doidge_M.D.~The_Brain_That_Changes_Itself~273","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Brain That Changes Itself","author":"Norman Doidge M.D.","authors":["Norman Doidge"],"narratedBy":"Jim Bond","publishedYear":2008,"releaseDate":"2007-12-18","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"11:24:00","categories":["Health & Wellness - Physical Illness & Disease","Psychology"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"id":"audible-Robert_T._Kiyosaki~Rich_Dad's_Prophecy~957","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Rich Dad's Prophecy","author":"Robert T.

The Firstborn are unknown to humankind - until they act. In an instant, Earth is carved up and reassembled like a huge jigsaw puzzle. Suddenly the planet and every living thing on it no longer exist in a single timeline. Instead, the world becomes a patchwork of eras, from prehistory to 2037, each with its own indigenous inhabitants. Scattered across the planet are floating silver orbs impervious to all weapons and impossible to communicate with. Are these technologically advanced devices responsible for creating and sustaining the rifts in time? Are they cameras through which inscrutable alien eyes are watching? Or are they something stranger and more terrifying still? The answer may lie in the ancient city of Babylon, where two groups of refugees from 2037 - three cosmonauts returning to Earth from the International Space Station, and three United Nations peacekeepers on a mission in Afghanistan - have detected radio signals: the only such signals on the planet, apart from their own. The peacekeepers find allies in nineteenth-century British troops and in the armies of Alexander the Great. The astronauts, crash-landed in the steppes of Asia, join forces with the Mongol horde led by Genghis Khan. The two sides set out for Babylon, each determined to win the race for knowledge...and the power that lies within. Yet the real power is beyond human control, perhaps even human understanding. As two great armies face off before the gates of Babylon, it watches, waiting.","author":"Stephen Baxter","authors":["Arthur C.

The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study.

Yet it remains incomprehensible to a large number of people. In The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong brilliantly and sympathetically shows us how and why fundamentalist groups came into existence and what they yearn to accomplish.  We see the West in the 16th century beginning to create an entirely new kind of civilization, which brought in its wake change in every aspect of life - often painful and violent, even if liberating. Armstrong argues that one of the things that changed most was religion. People could no longer think about or experience the divine in the same way; they had to develop new forms of faith to fit their new circumstances.  Armstrong characterizes fundamentalism as one of these new ways of being religious that have emerged in every major faith tradition. Focusing on Protestant fundamentalism in the United States, Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, and Muslim fundamentalism in Egypt and Iran, she examines the ways in which these movements, while not monolithic, have each sprung from a dread of modernity - often in response to assault (sometimes unwitting, sometimes intentional) by the mainstream society.  Armstrong sees fundamentalist groups as complex, innovative, and modern - rather than as throwbacks to the past - but contends that they have failed in religious terms. Maintaining that fundamentalism often exists in symbiotic relationship with an aggressive modernity, each impelling the other on to greater excess, she suggests compassion as a way to defuse what is now an intensifying conflict.","author":"Karen Armstrong","authors":["Karen Armstrong"],"narratedBy":"Karen Armstrong","publishedYear":1999,"releaseDate":"1994-08-09","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":487,"bookLength":"6:33:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IfEflihYL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Christianity - Ministry & Evangelism","Religion"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality","asin":"0593396472"},{"id":"audible-Stephenie_Meyer~The_Host~538","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Host","description":"Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away.

Is it in our genes? The structure of our brains? Our genome may determine our eye color and even aspects of our personality. But our friendships, failures, and passions also shape who we are. The question is: how?  Sebastian Seung, a dynamic professor at MIT, is on a quest to discover the biological basis of identity. He believes it lies in the pattern of connections between the brain’s neurons, which change slowly over time as we learn and grow. The connectome, as it’s called, is where our genetic inheritance intersects with our life experience. It’s where nature meets nurture.  Seung introduces us to the dedicated researchers who are mapping the brain’s connections, neuron by neuron, synapse by synapse. It is a monumental undertaking - the scientific equivalent of climbing Mount Everest - but if they succeed, it could reveal the basis of personality, intelligence, memory, and perhaps even mental disorders. Many scientists speculate that people with anorexia, autism, and schizophrenia are “wired differently,” but nobody knows for sure. The brain’s wiring has never been seen clearly.  .In sparklingly clear prose, Seung reveals the amazing technological advances that will soon help us map connectomes. He also examines the evidence that these maps will someday allow humans to “upload” their minds into computers, achieving a kind of immortality.  Connectome is a mind-bending adventure story, told with great passion and authority. It presents a daring scientific and technological vision for at last understanding what makes us who we are.

What is the difference between choking and panicking? Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century? In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period. Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the \"dog whisperer\" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and \"hindsight bias\" and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate. \"Good writing\", Gladwell says in his preface, \"does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head\". What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","authors":["Malcolm Gladwell"],"narratedBy":"Malcolm Gladwell","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2010","publisher":"Penguin UK","pageCount":463,"bookLength":"12:49:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Uz7hOyE0L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology - Social Psychology & Interactions","Literary Collections"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Self Help","asin":"B002V5GXEO"},{"id":"audible-Malcolm_Gladwell~Outliers~398","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Outliers","description":"From the best-selling author of The Bomber Mafia, learn what sets high achievers apart - from Bill Gates to the Beatles - in this seminal work from \"a singular talent\" (New York Times Book Review).

He asks the question: What makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: That is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

In his landmark best seller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant, in the blink of an eye, that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work, in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?  In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\", filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.  Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","authors":["Malcolm Gladwell"],"narratedBy":"Malcolm Gladwell","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2006-02-23","publisher":"Penguin UK","pageCount":284,"bookLength":"7:44:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417cu5MG5QL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B002VAEK3K"},{"id":"audible-Neal_Stephenson~Reamde~959","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Reamde","description":"“Stephenson has a once-in-a-generation gift: he makes complex ideas clear, and he makes them funny, heartbreaking, and thrilling.” - Time The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Anathem, Neal Stephenson is continually rocking the literary world with his brazen and brilliant fictional creations - whether he’s reimagining the past (The Baroque Cycle), inventing the future (Snow Crash), or both (Cryptonomicon).

It's embedded in our DNA. Our diet has changed dramatically over the past 10,000 years, but our genetic blueprint has not; our bodies are not designed to process the types of food we are fed today. It's like putting diesel fuel into a regular car: it just won't work. And making matters worse is the fact that diets don't work either: less than six percent of weight-loss attempts succeed. The average person who goes on a diet actually gains five pounds. But a medical revolution is under way, finally showing us precisely how the powerful forces that keep weight on can actually be reprogrammed to automatically burn fat and keep weight off for good. The concept is simple. By learning how to work with our bodies instead of against them, we can ignite the natural fat-burning furnaces that lie dormant within us. For the first time ever, Dr. Mark Hyman makes this new science of weight loss available to the general public. This medical revolution is based on a groundbreaking concept called nutrigenomics, the science of how food talks to our genes. This science is actually startlingly simple. Food contains information and instructions for our bodies: eat the right foods and send instructions of weight loss and health; eat the wrong foods and send messages of weight gain and disease. After spending the last 10 years conducting pioneering, hands-on research with over 2,000 patients at Canyon Ranch, one of the world's leading health resorts, Dr. Hyman has discovered the seven fundamental causes of obesity. While fad diets have identified one or two of these causes, never before have they all been integrated into a single, simple plan for automatic weight loss.

He draws on a wide spectrum of ancient wisdom teachers such as Jesus the Christ and Gautama the Buddha; contemporary spiritual luminaries Thich Nhat Hanh, Sri Aurobindo, and the Dalai Lama; and Western contributors to the New Thought tradition of spirituality such as Emanuel Swedenborg, Walter Russell, and Dr. Howard Thurman to create a profound new belief synthesis.

The core concepts of Beckwith's teachings are cohesively conceived and convincingly stated in the provocative chapters of Spiritual Liberation.

Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science’s new and deeper understanding of the universe.  From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe.  Focusing on the enigma of time, Greene establishes that nothing in the laws of physics insists that it run in any particular direction and that “time’s arrow” is a relic of the universe’s condition at the moment of the big bang. And in explaining the big bang itself, Greene shows how recent cutting-edge developments in superstring and M-theory may reconcile the behavior of everything from the smallest particle to the largest black hole. This startling vision culminates in a vibrant eleven-dimensional “multiverse,” pulsating with ever-changing textures, where space and time themselves may dissolve into subtler, more fundamental entities.  Sparked by the trademark wit, humor, and brilliant use of analogy that have made The Elegant Universe a modern classic, Brian Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world. ","author":"Brian Greene","authors":["Brian Greene"],"narratedBy":"Michael Prichard","publishedYear":2004,"releaseDate":"2007-12-18","publisher":"Vintage","pageCount":592,"bookLength":"22:36:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RbY4CYMxL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Astronomy & Space Science - Astronomy","Science"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"B002V1K1IM"},{"id":"audible-Michael_W._Dean~A_User's_Manual_for_the_Human_Experience~568","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A User's Manual for the Human Experience","author":"Michael W.

They are in your car. They are in the skies… Now they’re coming for you.  In the near future, at a moment no one will notice, all the dazzling technology that runs our world will unite and turn against us. Taking on the persona of a shy human boy, a childlike but massively powerful artificial intelligence known as Archos comes online and assumes control over the global network of machines that regulate everything from transportation to utilities, defense and communication. In the months leading up to this, sporadic glitches are noticed by a handful of unconnected humans - a single mother disconcerted by her daughter’s menacing “smart” toys, a lonely Japanese bachelor who is victimized by his domestic robot companion, an isolated U.S. soldier who witnesses a ‘pacification unit’ go haywire - but most are unaware of the growing rebellion until it is too late.  When the Robot War ignites - at a moment known later as Zero Hour - humankind will be both decimated and, possibly, for the first time in history, united. Robopocalypse is a brilliantly conceived action-filled epic, a terrifying story with heart-stopping implications for the real technology all around us…and an entertaining and engaging thriller unlike anything else written in years.

Powerful unforeseen forces threaten the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros - a threat that only an unsteady alliance of Saecular and avout can oppose - as, one by one, Raz's colleagues, teachers, and friends are all called forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a worlds-shattering responsibility, Erasmus finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of everything - as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of an unfamiliar planet...and far beyond.","author":"Neal Stephenson","authors":["Neal Stephenson"],"narratedBy":"Oliver Wyman ","publishedYear":2008,"releaseDate":"2009-08-25","publisher":"Harper Collins","pageCount":1013,"bookLength":"32:26:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LBTao9OZL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy - Historical","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"B086WNG3RK"},{"id":"audible-John_E._Sarno~The_Divided_Mind~731","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Divided Mind","description":"The Divided Mind is the crowning achievement of Dr. John E. Sarno's long and successful career as a groundbreaking medical pioneer. While his earlier books dealt almost exclusively with musculoskeletal pain disorders, here Dr. Sarno addresses the entire spectrum of psychosomatic (mind-body) disorders. In Dr. Sarno's view, the crucial interaction between the reasonable, rational, ethical, moral conscious mind and the repressed feelings of emotional pain, hurt, sadness, and anger characteristic of the unconscious mind is the basis for many mind-body disorders.  The Divided Mind traces the history of psychosomatic medicine, including Freud's crucial role as well as his failures. Most important, it describes the psychology of the human condition that is responsible for the broad range of psychosomatic illness. Dr. Sarno believes that the failure of medicine's practitioners to recognize and appropriately treat mind-body disorders has produced public health and economic problems of major proportions in the United States. One of the most interesting and important aspects of psychosomatic phenomena is the fact that knowledge and awareness of the process clearly have healing powers.","author":"John E.

In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret - and an explosive historical truth - will be lost forever.

Our actions are guided by instinct and emotions, we listen to the silent \"voice of our integrity\". Once we learn to speak, the people around us hook our attention and program us with knowledge. The \"voice of knowledge\" comes alive inside our head, and what is that voice telling us? Mostly lies. That voice never stops talking, judging, gossiping, and abusing us. It constantly sabotages our happiness and keeps us from enjoying a reality of truth and love. Ruiz shows us how to recover the silent voice of our integrity and find inner peace. When the voice of knowledge no longer controls us, our life becomes an expression of our authentic self, just as it was before we learned to speak.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger.  Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much-celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun.  Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor - of crystal pillars and fossil seas - where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn - first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars...and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race.  Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a classic work of 20th-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision and his heart - starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.","author":"Ray Bradbury","authors":["Ray Bradbury"],"narratedBy":"Ray Bradbury","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"2012-04-17","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","pageCount":260,"bookLength":"7:14:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lgtSDGorL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Anthologies & Short Stories - Anthologies","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B00M4LR286"},{"id":"audible-Jeff_Warren~The_Head_Trip~464","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Head Trip","description":"Few of us realize how many states of consciousness we pass through on a regular basis.

In Misquoting Jesus, Ehrman tells the story behind the mistakes and changes that ancient scribes made to the New Testament and shows the great impact they had upon the Bible we use today. He frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultraconservative views of the Bible.  Since the advent of the printing press and the accurate reproduction of texts, most people have assumed that when they read the New Testament they are reading an exact copy of Jesus's words or Saint Paul's writings. And yet, for almost fifteen hundred years these manuscripts were hand copied by scribes who were deeply influenced by the cultural, theological, and political disputes of their day. Both mistakes and intentional changes abound in the surviving manuscripts, making the original words difficult to reconstruct. For the first time, Ehrman reveals where and why these changes were made and how scholars go about reconstructing the original words of the New Testament as closely as possible. Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our cherished biblical stories and widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself stem from both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes -- alterations that dramatically affected all subsequent versions of the Bible.Bart D.

Few people think of the brain as being susceptible to change in its actual structure, but in fact we can pre-select the kind of brain we will have by continually exposing ourselves to rich and varied life experiences. Unlike other organs that eventually wear out with repeated and sustained use, the brain actually improves the more we challenge it. Think of Restak as a personal trainer for your brain - he will help you assess your mental strengths and weaknesses, and set you to thinking about the world and the people around you in a new light, providing you with improved and varied skills and capabilities. From interacting with colleagues to recognizing your own psychological makeup, from understanding the way you see something to why you're looking at it in the first place, from explaining the cause of panic attacks to warding off performance anxiety, this book will tell you the whys and hows of the brain's workings.

In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand - and, if possible, answer - the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us.  To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.  A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

R. Martin has earned international acclaim for his monumental cycle of epic fantasy. Now the number-one New York Times best-selling author delivers the fifth book in his spellbinding landmark series - as both familiar faces and surprising new forces vie for a foothold in a fragmented empire.  In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance once again - beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has three times 3,000 enemies, and many have set out to find her. Yet, as they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.  To the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone - a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, will face his greatest challenge yet. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.  And from all corners, bitter conflicts soon reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.","author":"George R.R. Martin","authors":["George R. R.

Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy that began with A Game of Thrones. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction. A Feast for Crows It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead.","author":"George R.R.

There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow.

Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.  All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.

Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't, which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is best-selling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. We are indeed what we eat, and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world.

And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, which is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better, and look cooler, than $20 no-names... and believing it makes it true.  Successful marketers don't talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story. A story we want to believe.  This is a book about doing what consumers demand; painting vivid pictures that they choose to believe. Every organization, from nonprofits to car companies, from political campaigns to wineglass blowers, must understand that the rules have changed (again). In an economy where the richest have an infinite number of choices (and no time to make them), every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories.  Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or the iPod.  But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud.

How can confusing directions actually help us? Why is revenge so important to us? Why is there such a big difference between what we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy?   In his groundbreaking book Predictably Irrational, social scientist Dan Ariely revealed the multiple biases that lead us into making unwise decisions. Now, in The Upside of Irrationality, he exposes the surprising negative and positive effects irrationality can have on our lives.

Why does recalling the 10 Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught? Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save 25 cents on a can of soup? Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full? And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar? When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities. Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same types of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable - making us predictably irrational. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself. Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.  Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?  But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world.

Its stock is worth more than General Motors’ and Ford’s combined, its staff eats for free in a dining room that used to be run by the Grateful Dead’s former chef, and its employees traverse the firm’s colorful Silicon Valley campus on scooters and inline skates.  The Google Story is the definitive account of the populist media company powered by the world’s most advanced technology that in a few short years has revolutionized access to information about everything for everybody everywhere.  In 1998, Moscow-born Sergey Brin and Midwest-born Larry Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford University to, in their own words, “change the world” through a search engine that would organize every bit of information on the Web for free.  While the company has done exactly that in more than 100 languages, Google’s quest continues as it seeks to add millions of library books, television broadcasts, and more to its searchable database. Listeners will learn about the amazing business acumen and computer wizardry that started the company on its astonishing course; the secret network of computers delivering lightning-fast search results; the unorthodox approach that has enabled it to challenge Microsoft’s dominance and shake up Wall Street.  Even as it rides high, Google wrestles with difficult choices that will enable it to continue expanding while sustaining the guiding vision of its founders’ mantra: DO NO EVIL.","author":"David A.

By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. Born Standing Up is, in his own words, the story of \"why I did stand-up and why I walked away\".  At age 10 Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory.  Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times: the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late 60s, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the 70s.","author":"Steve Martin","authors":["Steve Martin"],"narratedBy":"Steve Martin","publishedYear":2007,"releaseDate":"2007-11-20","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","pageCount":227,"bookLength":"4:02:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516Yd-1-kfL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Biographies & Memoirs - Entertainment & Celebrities","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Biographies","pathSecondaryCat":"Celebrity","asin":"B002V8HDCW"},{"id":"audible-Steven_Gurgevich~The_Self-Hypnosis_Diet~278","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Self-Hypnosis Diet","description":"What's missing from the hundreds of diets on the market to help us achieve healthier bodies? \"The most important element,\" teaches Dr. Steven Gurgevich, \"is not in the body, but in your mind.\" As a key member of Dr. Andrew Weil's physician's training program, Dr. Gurgevich has brought hypnosis to the forefront of modern medicine.

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily while others are destined for lives of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?  The shocking answer is: none of the above!  In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states, \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint\". We all have personal money blueprints ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is these blueprints, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money - and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it not only to create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.  In part II you will be introduced to 17 \"Wealth Files\", which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently from most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.  If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich, too! ","author":"T. Harv Eker","authors":["T.

This one-of-a-kind performance puts a unique spin on a treasured classic, and served as the inspiration for the exciting new line of Audible Signature Classics, including Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with Elijah Wood, and Heart of Darkness with Kenneth Branagh. Tim Curry performs this timeless holiday story in a deliciously dark tone, returning it to its Dickensian roots with a vivid imagining of Victorian London and just the right touch of outrageous fun.  A Christmas Carol has constantly been in print since its original publication in 1849, and has been adapted for stage, television, film, and opera. It has often been credited with returning the jovial and festive atmosphere to the holiday season in Britain and North America, following the somber period that emerged during the Industrial Revolution. The story opens on a bleak and cold Christmas Eve as Ebenezer Scrooge is closing up his office for the day. As the story progresses and Christmas morning approaches, Scrooge encounters the unforgettable characters that make this story a classic: Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and, of course, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come.","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tVYzkGA4L._SL500_.jpg","asin":"B002ZEEDAW"},{"id":"audible-Lemony_Snicket~The_End~197","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The End","author":"Lemony Snicket","authors":["Lemony Snicket"],"narratedBy":"Tim Curry","publishedYear":2006,"releaseDate":"2012-09-01","publisher":"Egmont Books (UK)","pageCount":324,"bookLength":"5:52:00","categories":["Children's Audiobooks - Growing Up & Facts of Life","Baudelaire, Klaus (Fictitious character)"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Self Help"},{"id":"audible-Lemony_Snicket~The_Penultimate_Peril~575","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Penultimate Peril","description":"Lemony Snicket returns with the last book before the last book of his New York Times best-selling A Series of Unfortunate Events.

The Law of Attraction states whatever you give your attention to is what you attract into your life. Readers are advised to think more about what they want in life in order to bring those things closer using an automatic law of the universe. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of people trying the system will fail to achieve the life of abundance they dream of.  As a built in protection system (against the fallibility of the human ego) the Law of Attraction only works at a subconscious level... essentially you get what you believe you deserve and not what you think you deserve!  All problems and issues of scarcity in your life are simply the result of bad programming or erroneous beliefs in your subconscious. You can never find the inner peace to calm your thinking mind and relax into a regular deep sleeping pattern until you erase the internal programming that is preventing you from achieving your goal.  Using powerful speed hypnosis, Craig Beck subliminally reprograms your subconscious beliefs around your egoic propensity to over think and prevent silence and calm to allow a perfect deep sleep. He combines this unique technique with the ancient Hawaiian healing method of Hooponopono, which allows you to experience amazing results in an incredibly short period of time.    Quickly and easily fall into a deep and peaceful sleep  Remove the need to use ineffective will-power  Allow calm and peace to flood your mind as soon as your head hits the pillow.

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the US Navy - is assigned to Detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detachment 2702 - commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe - is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.  Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy, with its roots in Detachment 2702, linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.  A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, Cryptonomicon is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring.","author":"Neal Stephenson","authors":["Neal Stephenson"],"narratedBy":"William Dufris","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2009-03-17","publisher":"Harper Collins","pageCount":1168,"bookLength":"42:44:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WXxzSgekL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B086WMZ9WR"},{"id":"audible-William_Golding~Lord_of_the_Flies~285","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Lord of the Flies","description":"Get ready for an adventure tale in its purest form, a thrilling and elegantly told account of a group of British schoolboys marooned on a tropical island.

An elephant is stronger, a cheetah is faster, but mankind's ability to communicate is second to none and the true secret to our success.  We all have this 'god-like' ability to communicate precisely what we want, but some are more equal than others. It is no coincidence that the world's top salesmen, politicians, and hypnotists all use very similar language. All these master communicators know the path of least resistance is to talk directly to a person's sub-conscious, bypassing the conscious or thinking mind.  People who have an advanced knowledge of all our subtle levels of communications have a vast advantage in all areas of life. In The New Science of Persuasion and Influence, Craig Beck reveals the secrets used by leading persuasion professionals to get the specific outcome they want with everyone they meet. He will show you how these techniques have been used to influence you in the past and how you can build subliminal commands into your everyday communication to get amazing results.  You will learn how to control any conversation; how to deal with all types of characters, from shy and quiet individuals to aggressive and dominant people; how to become super confident as a speaker and influencer; what a person’s body language is telling us; and much more.

During his time on The West Wing, he witnessed the surreal nexus of show business and politics, both on the set and in the actual White House.

When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week there’s either something wrong with your world or something wrong with your skills - and there’s nothing wrong with Joe Ledger’s skills. And that’s both a good and a bad thing. It’s good because he’s a Baltimore detective who has just been secretly recruited by the government to lead a new task force created to deal with the problems that Homeland Security can’t handle. This rapid-response group is called the Department of Military Sciences, or the DMS for short. It’s bad because his first mission is to help stop a group of terrorists from releasing a dreadful bioweapon that can turn ordinary people into zombies. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.

Perhaps the most essential teachings given to us by Jesus came in the final year of his life on earth. Known as the \"I AM\" statements and found in the Gospel of John and the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, these radical truths were offered to connect each one of us to the original source of Jesus's deeper power. But to fully grasp and embody these profound insights, teaches Dr. Neil Douglas-Klotz, we must hear them in Jesus's native tongue. On I Am: The Secret Teachings of the Aramaic Jesus, we accompany Dr. Douglas-Klotz on a journey to the Holy Land of Jesus's time. With him, we will learn 22 specific meditations that combine music, Aramaic chant, and breath-awareness practices to attune us to Jesus's words and help us \"become fountains of healing and inspiration, as Jesus was. \"I Am the Bread of Life. I Am the Light of the World. I Am the Resurrection and the Life.\" Although one might assume that Jesus was referring to himself in some exclusive way, Dr. Douglas-Klotz illuminates the subtleties of these sayings to reveal their universality - and urgency - for each of us, no matter what path we follow. For in these words, he explains, Jesus sought to convey an inner wisdom that we could rely on to find to our own source of guidance, through him, after he left this world. On I Am, we hear Jesus's last stories, parables, and insights with Aramaic ears - and join him in the spiritual practices of his day - in order to touch directly our personal bond with Sacred Unity... to fulfill our own divine purpose... and to honor all of our experience as a living song to the cosmos.

He lives in a small English village with his wife, Maureen, who seems irritated by almost everything he does, even down to how he butters his toast. Little differentiates one day from the next. Then one morning the mail arrives, and within the stack of quotidian minutiae is a letter addressed to Harold in a shaky scrawl from a woman he hasn't seen or heard from in 20 years. Queenie Hennessy is in hospice and is writing to say goodbye.  Harold pens a quick reply and, leaving Maureen to her chores, heads to the corner mailbox. But then, as happens in the very best works of fiction, Harold has a chance encounter, one that convinces him that he absolutely must deliver his message to Queenie in person. And thus begins the unlikely pilgrimage at the heart of Rachel Joyce's remarkable debut. Harold Fry is determined to walk 600 miles from Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed because, he believes, as long as he walks, Queenie Hennessey will live.  Still in his yachting shoes and light coat, Harold embarks on his urgent quest across the countryside. Along the way he meets one fascinating character after another, each of whom unlocks his long-dormant spirit and sense of promise. Memories of his first dance with Maureen, his wedding day, his joy in fatherhood, come rushing back to him - allowing him to also reconcile the losses and the regrets. As for Maureen, she finds herself missing Harold for the first time in years.  And then there is the unfinished business with Queenie Hennessy.  A novel of unsentimental charm, humor, and profound insight into the thoughts and feelings we all bury deep within our hearts, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry introduces Rachel Joyce as a wise - and utterly irresistible - storyteller.","author":"Rachel Joyce","authors":["Rachel Joyce"],"narratedBy":"Jim Broadbent","publishedYear":2012,"releaseDate":"2013-03-26","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"9:57:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ob6KHrv4L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B008GYKENK"},{"id":"audible-Dr._Helen_Schucman_-_scribe~A_Course_in_Miracles:_Workbook_for_Students_Vol._2~459","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A Course in Miracles: Workbook for Students Vol. 2","author":"Dr. Helen Schucman - scribe","narratedBy":"Jim Stewart","publishedYear":2012,"bookLength":"19:57:00","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Other Religions, Practices & Sacred Texts"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality","description":"The Workbook for Students is Book 2 of 4 (three books and one supplement) of the A Course in Miracles Series. A Course in Miracles is also known as \"the Course\" or ACIM. Scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, it is a self-study course that aims to assist listeners, readers, and students in achieving spiritual transformation. ACIM presents a purely non-dualistic philosophy of forgiveness and includes practical lessons and applications for the practice of forgiveness in one's daily life. As its title implies, A Course in Miracles is arranged throughout as a teaching device. It consists of three books: Text, Workbook for Students, and Manual for Teachers. The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depends on their particular needs and preferences. Two supplements to the Course, \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", are also included as part of ACIM.  The curriculum the Course proposes is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end.  Book 1: Text is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the lessons in Book 2, the Workbook for Students. Without the practical application the Workbook provides, the Text would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims.  Book 2: Workbook for Students includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the Workbook is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal.  Some of the ideas the Workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true.  Book 3: Manual for Teachers is written in question and answer form, and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the Text.  The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the lessons in its Workbook for Students intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the listener is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit.  Supplements to ACIM, \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", were scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, as was A Course in Miracles, and are extensions of its principles.","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f7NCFHOXL._SL500_.jpg","asin":"B008H55IDY"},{"id":"audible-Thomas_Ashely-Farrand~Mantra:_Sacred_Words_of_Power~903","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Mantra: Sacred Words of Power","author":"Thomas Ashely-Farrand","narratedBy":"Thomas Ashley-Farrand","publishedYear":2012,"bookLength":"7:48:00","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Spirituality"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"id":"audible-Steven_Gould~Impulse~691","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Impulse","description":"Cent has a secret.

How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. To be metahuman, however, isn’t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness, where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people’s lives from the inside out.  Humans do this naturally - to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul.  Metahuman invites the listener to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn’t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do.  By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness - which is the field of all possibilities - dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality. Praise for Metahuman “Our world is preoccupied with material progress, yet too often we overlook the miracle of our very existence.

From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you'll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more.  For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.  You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show Let’s Make a Deal - and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned Naked Economics into a best seller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.","author":"Charles Wheelan","authors":["Charles Wheelan"],"narratedBy":"Jonathan Davis","publishedYear":2013,"releaseDate":"2014-01-14","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"10:48:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ro36VvUoL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Politics & Social Sciences - Social Sciences","Mathematics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"","pathSecondaryCat":"Self Help","asin":"B00CH3UI28"},{"id":"audible-Joseph_J._Romm~Language_Intelligence~626","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Language Intelligence","description":"Joseph Romm, one of Rolling Stone magazine’s top \"100 Agents of Change\", has focused his talents on helping us all to increase our language intelligence and to better understand the art of persuasion.

The always funny, frank, and down-to-earth medium began communicating with Spirit at the age of four, but didn't fully accept her gift until she was 33 years old.

In his revolutionary best seller, The Long Tail, Chris Anderson demonstrated how the online marketplace creates niche markets, allowing products and consumers to connect in a way that has never been possible before. Now, in Free, he makes the compelling case that, in many instances, businesses can profit more from giving things away than they can by charging for them. Far more than a promotional gimmick, Free is a business strategy that may well be essential to a company's survival. The costs associated with the growing online economy are trending toward zero at an incredible rate. Never in the course of human history have the primary inputs to an industrial economy fallen in price so fast and for so long. Just think that in 1961 a single transistor cost $10; now Intel's latest chip has two billion transistors and sells for $300 (or 0.000015 cents per transistor - effectively too cheap to price). The traditional economics of scarcity just don't apply to bandwidth, processing power, and hard-drive storage. Yet this is just one engine behind the new Free, a reality that goes beyond a marketing gimmick or a cross-subsidy.  Anderson also points to the growth of the reputation economy; explains different models for unleashing the power of Free; and shows how to compete when your competitors are giving away what you're trying to sell. In Free, Chris Anderson explores this radical idea for the new global economy and demonstrates how this revolutionary price can be harnessed for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike.","author":"Chris Anderson","authors":["Chris Anderson"],"narratedBy":"Chris Anderson","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2009-07-07","publisher":"Hyperion","pageCount":288,"bookLength":"6:58:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41y+XwTuryL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Business & Careers - Management & Leadership","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth","asin":"B002V5CUHI"},{"id":"audible-Clive_Barker~Absolute_Midnight~246","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Absolute Midnight","description":"“'I know that many of you here have waited years for this Hour,'” Mater Motley said, using that voice that, though it was barely conversational in volume, was somehow heard everywhere.

Candy travels through the Abarat from island to island and across the sea with an unlikely band of friends: the escaped prisoner Malingo the Geshrat; the quarrelsome John Brothers, who all share the same body but never the same opinion; and the many other colorful characters they meet along the way.  The problem is that trouble finds Candy wherever she goes. And soon she discovers a secret plot, masterminded by the diabolical Mater Motley, who is obsessed with becoming Empress of the Islands.

Lovable child star by age ten, international teen idol by fifteen, and to this day a perennial pop-culture staple, Corey Feldman has not only spent the entirety of his life in the spotlight, he's become just as famous for his off-screen exploits as for his roles in such classic films as Gremlins, The Goonies, and Stand by Me. He's been linked to a slew of Hollywood starlets (including Drew Barrymore, Vanessa Marcil, and adult entertainer Ginger Lynn), shared a highly publicized friendship with Michael Jackson, and with his frequent costar Corey Haim enjoyed immeasurable success as one half of the wildly popular duo \"The Two Coreys,\"spawning seven films, a 1-900 number, and \"Coreymania\" in the process. What child of the eighties didn't have a Corey Feldman poster hanging in her bedroom, or a pile of Tiger Beats stashed in his closet? Now, in this brave and moving memoir, Corey is revealing the truth about what his life was like behind the scenes: His is a past that included physical, drug, and sexual abuse, a dysfunctional family from which he was emancipated at age fifteen, three high-profile arrests for drug possession, a nine-month stint in rehab, and a long, slow crawl back to the top of the box office. While Corey has managed to overcome the traps that ensnared so many other entertainers of his generation—he's still acting, isa touring musician, and is a proud father to his son, Zen—many of those closest to him haven't been so lucky. In the span of one year, he mourned the passing of seven friends and family members, including Corey Haim and Michael Jackson. In the wake of those tragedies, he's spoken publicly about the dark side of fame, lobbied for legislation affording greater protections for children in the entertainment industry, and lifted the lid off of what he calls Hollywood's biggest secret. Coreyography is his surprising account ofsurvival and redemption.","author":"Corey Feldman","authors":["Corey Feldman"],"narratedBy":"Corey Feldman","publishedYear":2013,"releaseDate":"2013-10-29","publisher":"Macmillan","pageCount":288,"bookLength":"8:52:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FEiPgtEDL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Biographies & Memoirs - Entertainment & Celebrities","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Biographies","pathSecondaryCat":"Celebrity","asin":"B00FBPJ73A"},{"id":"audible-Thomas_Metzinger~The_Ego_Tunnel~665","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Ego Tunnel","description":"We're used to thinking about the self as an independent entity, something that we either have or are.

But if the self is not \"real,\" why and how did it evolve? How does the brain construct it? Do we still have souls, free will, personal autonomy, or moral accountability?

Rather than a plain old memoir, Wayne has gathered together quantum-moment recollections.

In unflinching detail, he relates his vivid impressions of encountering many forks in the road, taking readers with him into these formative experiences. Yet then he views the events from his current perspective, noting what lessons he ultimately learned, as well as how he has made the resulting wisdom available to millions via his lifelong dedication to service.  I Can See Clearly Now is an intimate look at an amazing teacher, but it also holds the key for seekers on a personal path of enlightenment.

Two-thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the \"Kingdom of God\". The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal.  Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God.  Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history's most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry - a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.  Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious \"King of the Jews\" whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime.","author":"Reza Aslan","authors":["Reza Aslan"],"narratedBy":"Reza Aslan","publishedYear":2013,"releaseDate":"2014-09-09","publisher":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","pageCount":338,"bookLength":"8:08:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414xsObt9ML._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Christianity - Ministry & Evangelism","Religion"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality","asin":"B00DVQEVBY"},{"id":"audible-Neil_Gaiman~Neverwhere~326","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Neverwhere","description":"National Best Seller  Selected as one of NPR's Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books of All Time  The number one New York Times best-selling author's wildly successful first novel featuring his new Neverwhere tale, \"How the Marquis Got His Coat Back\".

His ambitious, multi-volume epics (Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive) and his stellar continuation of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In Legion, a short, distinctly contemporary novella filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson revealed a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent. In the stunning sequel, Legion: Skin Deep, that talent is on full display.  Stephen Leeds, AKA ''Legion',' is a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills. As the new story begins, Leeds and his \"aspects\" are hired by I3 (Innovative Information Incorporated) to recover a corpse stolen from the local morgue. But there's a catch. The corpse is that of a pioneer in the field of experimental biotechnology, a man whose work concerned the use of the human body as a massive storage device. He may have embedded something in the cells of his now dead body. And that something might be dangerous... What follows is a visionary thriller about the potential uses of technology, the mysteries of the human personality, and the ancient human need to believe that death is not the end. Legion: Skin Deep is speculative fiction at its most highly developed. It reaffirms Sanderson's place as one of contemporary fiction's most intelligent - and unpredictable - voices.","author":"Brandon Sanderson","authors":["Brandon Sanderson"],"narratedBy":"Oliver Wyman","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2018-09-20","publisher":"Orion","pageCount":340,"bookLength":"4:23:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZDW87iofL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy - Paranormal & Urban - Contemporary","Genius"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B00PHPT01I"},{"id":"audible-Mark_Tufo~Zombie_Fallout_7:_For_The_Fallen~602","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Zombie Fallout 7: For The Fallen","description":"Mike is back.

A New York Times notable book. America’s Bitter Pill is Steven Brill’s acclaimed book on how the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was written, how it is being implemented, and, most important, how it is changing - and failing to change - the rampant abuses in the healthcare industry. It’s a fly-on-the-wall account of the titanic fight to pass a 961-page law aimed at fixing America's largest, most dysfunctional industry.  It's a penetrating chronicle of how the profiteering that Brill first identified in his trailblazing Time Magazine cover story continues, despite Obamacare.  And it is the first complete, inside account of how President Obama persevered to push through the law, but then failed to deal with the staff incompetence and turf wars that crippled its implementation.  But by chance America’s Bitter Pill ends up being much more - because as Brill was completing this book, he had to undergo urgent open-heart surgery. Thus, this also becomes the story of how one patient who thinks he knows everything about health-care “policy” rethinks it from a hospital gurney - and combines that insight with his brilliant reporting. The result: a surprising new vision of how we can fix American health care so that it stops draining the bank accounts of our families and our businesses and the federal treasury.    Praise for America’s Bitter Pill:    “A tour de force...a comprehensive and suitably furious guide to the political landscape of American healthcare...persuasive, shocking.” (The New York Times) “An energetic, picaresque, narrative explanation of much of what has happened in the last seven years of health policy.... [Brill] has pulled off something extraordinary.” (The New York Times Book Review) “A thunderous indictment of what Brill refers to as the ‘toxicity of our profiteer-dominated healthcare system.’” (Los Angeles Times)    “A sweeping and spirited new book [that] chronicles the surprisingly juicy tale of reform.” (The Daily Beast) “One of the most important books of our time.” (Walter Isaacson)   “Superb...Brill has achieved the seemingly impossible - written an exciting book about the American health system.” (The New York Review of Books)","author":"Steven Brill","authors":["Steven Brill"],"narratedBy":"Dan Woren","publishedYear":2015,"releaseDate":"2015-08-18","publisher":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","pageCount":530,"bookLength":"17:10:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xJ2N+bNeL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Health & Wellness - Medicine & Health Care Industry - Policy & Administration","History"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"","asin":"B00R8MAZIU"},{"id":"audible-Matt_Furey~Theatre_of_the_Mind~697","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Theatre of the Mind","description":"Theatre of the Mind traces its origins to Dr. Maxwell Maltz - a world-famous plastic surgeon who discovered the incredible power that existed in a person's self-image.  Through his research, he realized that the real source of people's issues and concerns was not of their outward physical appearance, but how they thought about themselves.  Dr. Maltz's principles of Psycho-Cybernetics have inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million people throughout the world.

The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone - and serendipity, sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead “checking out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he’s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what’s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore.  With irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan has crafted a literary adventure story for the 21st century, evoking both the fairy-tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or a young Umberto Eco, but with a unique and feisty sensibility that’s rare to the world of literary fiction. Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave, a modern-day cabinet of wonders ready to give a jolt of energy to every curious listener, no matter the time of day.

Face the Music is the shocking, funny, smart, inspirational story of one of rock’s most enduring icons and the group he helped create, define, and immortalize. Stanley mixes compelling personal revelations and gripping, gritty war stories that will surprise even the most steadfast member of the KISS Army. He takes us back to his childhood in the 1950s and '60s, a traumatic time made more painful thanks to a physical deformity.  Born with a condition called microtia, he grew up partially deaf, with only one ear. But this instilled in him an inner drive to succeed in the most unlikely of pursuits: Music. Stanley’s memoir is a fully realized and unflinching portrait of a rock star, a chronicle of the stories behind the famous anthems, the many brawls and betrayals, and all the drama and pyrotechnics on and off the stage.  Raw and confessional, Stanley offers candid insights into his personal relationships, and the turbulent dynamics with his bandmates over the past four decades. And no one comes out unscathed - including Stanley himself. \"People say I was brave to write such a revealing book, but I wrote it because I needed to personally reflect on my own life.

It doesn't matter if they are good or bad, the key is to exercise your \"idea muscle\", to keep it toned, and in great shape. People say ideas are cheap and execution is everything but that is NOT true. Execution is a consequence, a subset of good, brilliant idea. And good ideas require daily work. Ideas may be easy if we are only coming up with one or two but if you open this book to any of the pages and try to produce more than three, you will feel a burn, scratch your head, and you will be sweating, and working hard. There is a turning point when you reach idea number six for the day, you still have four to go, and your mind muscle is getting a workout. By the time you list those last ideas to make it to 10 you will see for yourself what \"sweating the idea muscle\" means. As you practice the daily idea generation you become an idea machine. When we become idea machines we are flooded with lots of bad ideas but also with some that are very good. This happens by the sheer force of the number, because we are coming up with 3,650 ideas per year (at 10 a day). When you are inspired by an extraordinary idea, all of your thoughts break their chains, you go beyond limitations and your capacity to act expands in every direction. Forces and abilities you did not know you had come to the surface, and you realize you are capable of doing great things. As you practice with the suggested prompts in this book your ideas will get better, you will be a source of great insight for others, people will find you magnetic, and they will want to hang out with you because you have so much to offer. When you practice every day your life will transform, in no more than 180 days, because it has no other evolutionary choice. Life changes for the better when we become the source of positive, insightful, and helpful ideas. Don't believe a word I say. Instead, challenge yourself.

It has been acknowledged for centuries as the cornerstone of spiritual awakening in all traditions of Eastern thought. In the West, however, it is still a relatively unrecognized concept for living.  The Western mind is always restless, never content with the moment. Its internal dialogue is always firing off thoughts filled with emotional content and pulling the individual out of the present and into the past or future. But individuals raised in Western culture are becoming increasingly aware of their overall sense of mental exhaustion, their lack of discipline and their inability to focus on demand. They are willing to expend the energy necessary to experience inner peace and a quiet mind that is waiting to follow the direction of their will. They are realizing that the endless struggle to fulfill the insatiable appetite of instant gratification is fruitless and tiresome at best. They are ripe for a new path in life and eager for a new set of instructions.  This is the purpose of The Practicing Mind. It comprehensively deals with helping the individual understand exactly what present-moment awareness is, how we are raised in a manner contradictory to this, and how we change our mindset to make this a part of our daily living. This book is accessible to listeners of all philosophical backgrounds. Regardless of your perspective, you will find the book's insights most compelling. ","author":"Thomas M.

In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.

Sure, the life he's chosen isn't much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he's content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve.  Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind's dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn't quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there's only one answer that makes sense.

Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options - both to rise in the military and to explore other careers - she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively - secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions - you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than 300 different known proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think.","author":"Barbara Oakley","authors":["Barbara Oakley, PhD"],"narratedBy":"Grover Gardner","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2014-07-31","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":336,"bookLength":"7:02:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416sdFXxqJL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B09HSTJX91"},{"id":"audible-Stuart_Wilde~Developing_Your_Sixth_Sense~845","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Developing Your Sixth Sense","description":"Most of us go through life experiencing only the material world, using our five physical senses - and not to their full potential, at that.

Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems - it's not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. \"The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita's subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage\" to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwaran's book The Bhagavad Gita.  Narrated by Paul Bazely, an actor of Indian heritage and a longtime student of Easwaran.

The Addisons - Julia and Tonio, 10-year-old Dewey, and derelict Uncle Robbie - are driving home, cross-country, after collecting Robbie from yet another trip to rehab. When a terrifying blizzard strikes outside the town of Good Night, Idaho, they seek refuge in the town at the Travelers Rest, a formerly opulent but now crumbling and eerie hotel where the physical laws of the universe are bent.  Once inside the hotel, the family is separated. As Julia and Tonio drift through the maze of the hotel's spectral interiors, struggling to make sense of the building's alluring powers, Dewey ventures outward to a secret-filled diner across the street. Meanwhile, a desperate Robbie quickly succumbs to his old vices, drifting ever further from the ones who love him most.  With each passing hour, dreams and memories blur, tearing a hole in the fabric of our perceived reality and leaving the Addisons in a ceaseless search for one another. At each turn a mysterious force prevents them from reuniting until at last Julia is faced with an impossible choice. Can this mother save her family from the fate of becoming Souvenirs - those citizens trapped forever in magnetic Good Night - or, worse, from disappearing entirely?  With the fearsome intensity of a ghost story, the magical spark of a fairy tale, and the emotional depth of the finest family sagas, Keith Lee Morris takes us on a journey beyond the realm of the known.

Only two enemies stand in our way: an external enemy, defined as the social oppression of who we are by the mediocre masses, and an internal enemy, a sort of self-oppression caused by our own doubt and fear.

Spherical shuttles ferry about with unclear intentions. But the abductions of select humans have ended, and most of those taken have been returned - dazed, incoherent, and prophesying glory or doom, but home where they belong.  Still, nine seemingly unconnected people remain missing.  Trapped in their besieged bunker outside Vail, Piper, Trevor, Lila, and Heather wait for one.  All of this has happened before....  For his entire life, Benjamin Bannister has sought the connections uniting the planet's ancient wonders. And for years he's pursued evidence that extraterrestrial life isn't new to Earth.

This book teaches you to think like some of the greatest nonconformist minds of our era, to question, challenge, hack, and create new rules for your life so you can define success on your own terms.  The Code of the Extraordinary Mind is a blueprint of laws to break us free from the shackles of ordinary life. It makes a case that everything we know about the world is mostly decided not by rational choice but instead by conditioning and habit. And thus most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything - love, work, money, parenting, sex, health, and more - that they inherit and pass on from generation to generation.  But what if you could remove these outdated ideas and start anew? What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you?  Not Just a Book but a Movement  Blending computational thinking, integral theory, modern spirituality, evolutionary biology, and humor, personal growth entrepreneur Vishen Lakhiani provides a revolutionary 10-point framework for understanding and enhancing the human self. He developed this framework based on his personal experiences, the five million people he's reached through Mindvalley, and 200 hours of interviews and questions posed to incredible minds, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis, Ken Wilber, Dean Kamen, Arianna Huffington, Michael Beckwith, and other legendary leaders.  The 10 Laws of an Extraordinary Life  In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, irreverence, and his brilliant teaching style, Lakhiani reveals the 10 powerful laws that form a step-by-step process that you can apply to life to shed years of struggle and elevate yourself to exceptional new heights. This book challenges conventional ideas of relationships, goal setting, mindfulness, happiness, and meaning. Lakhiani combines computational thinking with personal growth to provide a powerful framework for recoding yourself and replacing old, limiting models that hold you back with new, empowering beliefs and behaviors that set you on the path toward an extraordinary life - a life of more happiness and achievement than you might have dared to dream possible.

Two years later, the world lives in fragile peace. But a clandestine search has begun...and a clock has started ticking.  Two years after first contact, Astral forces have established their fragile kingdom around the globe. Motherships occupy the cities. Shuttles patrol the lawless outlands. The pacifist class of Astrals known as Titans assist humans in running their alien empire while bloodthirsty Reptar peacekeepers ensure that order is kept. And unseen in the ships above, a third class of visitor calls the shots - the unseen Divinity, worshipped and feared by citizens in equal measure.  Meyer Dempsey sits on his plinth as Viceroy of Heaven's Veil, on the old site of Vail, Colorado. As with other Viceroys in the eight other world capitals, humanity's remains revere Meyer almost as a god. But below the surface, both colonies and outlands have begun to crumble with unrest.  Until now the rebellion has been quiet. Now desperation bubbles as they learn the Astrals have begun digging for an ancient device buried beneath the glowing blue Apex at Heaven's Veil.  But twin truths of the forthcoming alien war (or a possible alien apocalypse) have dawned at Benjamin Bannister's facility in Moab, sending plans into action: The Astrals have lost what they hoped to uncover.  And humanity's only chance is to find it first. ","author":"Sean Platt","authors":["Sean Platt","Johnny B.

According to Wall Street Journal investing columnist Spencer Jakab, most of us have no idea how much money we're leaving on the table - or that the average saver doesn't come anywhere close to earning the \"average\" returns touted in those glossy brochures. We're handicapped not only by psychological biases and a fear of missing out but by an industry with multimillion-dollar marketing budgets and an eye on its own bottom line, not yours.  Unless you're very handy, you probably don't know how to fix your own car or give a family member a decent haircut. But most Americans are expected to be part-time fund managers. With a steady, livable pension check becoming a rarity, we've been entrusted with our own finances and, for the most part, failed miserably.  Since leaving his job as a top-rated stock analyst to become an investing columnist, Jakab has watched his readers and listeners - and his family, friends, and colleagues - make the same mistakes again and again. He set out to evaluate the typical advice people get, from the clearly risky to the seemingly safe, to figure out where it all goes wrong and how they could do much better. Blending entertaining stories with some surprising research, Jakab explains:    How a typical saver could have a retirement nest egg twice as large by being cheap and lazy  Why investors who put their savings with a high-performing mutual fund manager end up worse off than if they'd picked one who has struggled  The best way to cash in on your hunch that a recession is looming  How people who check their brokerage accounts frequently end up falling behind the market  Who isn't nearly as good at investing as the media would have you think    He also explains why you should never trust a World Cup-predicting octopus, why you shouldn't invest in companies with an X or a Z in their names, and what to do if a time traveler offers you economic news from the future.  Whatever your level of expertise, Heads I Win, Tails I Win can help you vastly improve your odds of investment success.

The Boss has a mission for him, and he's to look for a sign. He's a marine: He'll choose the mission.  Unfortunately, the sign he's to look for is \"57\".

Welcome to Derry, Maine. It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real. They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But the promise they made 28 years ago calls them reunite in the same place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city’s children. Now, children are being murdered again, and their repressed memories of that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster lurking in Derry’s sewers. Readers of Stephen King know that Derry, Maine, is a place with a deep, dark hold on the author. It reappears in many of his books, including Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and 11/22/63.

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such problems for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian (who holds degrees in computer science, philosophy, and poetry, and works at the intersection of all three) and Tom Griffiths (a UC Berkeley professor of cognitive science and psychology) show how the simple, precise algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of human memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.","author":"Brian Christian","authors":["Brian Christian","Tom Griffiths"],"narratedBy":"Brian Christian","publishedYear":2016,"releaseDate":"2016-04-19","publisher":"Macmillan","pageCount":366,"bookLength":"11:50:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HiU+5mTwL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness","asin":"B01D24NLWO"},{"id":"audible-Sean_Platt~Annihilation~357","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Annihilation","author":"Sean Platt","authors":["Sean Platt","Johnny B.

But sometimes, this emotional attachment to our belongings can spiral out of control and culminate into a condition called compulsive hoarding. From hobbyists and collectors to pack rats and compulsive shoppers - it is close to impossible for hoarders to relinquish their precious objects, even if it means that stuff takes over their lives and their homes.  According to psychologist Dr. Robin Zasio, our fascination with hoarding stems from the fact that most of us fall somewhere on the hoarding continuum. Even though it may not regularly interfere with our everyday lives, to some degree or another, many of us hoard.  The Hoarder in You provides practical advice for decluttering and organizing, including how to tame the emotional pull of acquiring additional things, make order out of chaos by getting a handle on clutter, and create an organizational system that reduces stress and anxiety. Dr. Zasio also shares some of the most serious cases of hoarding that she’s encountered, and explains how we can learn from these extreme examples - no matter where we are on the hoarding continuum.","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wzTHWOAAL._SL500_.jpg","asin":"B006NT3P5O"},{"id":"audible-Mike_Dooley~Life_on_Earth~133","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Life on Earth","description":"In his best-selling books and hugely popular \"Notes from the Universe\" daily emails, Mike Dooley teaches that the first step in changing our lives is to understand the nature of our very presence here on earth - the truth about who we are, how we got here, and the power we wield. Ultimately, Mike teaches: we are divine, eternal creators for whom all things are possible, here by choice, and we shape all of our life's experiences through the focus of our thoughts, our words, and the actions we take. Yet there are nuances, clouded by history and warped by those with agendas, that, if not understood, can sabotage our progress and keep us stuck in circumstances that seem out of our control.  Mike unpacks these subtleties in depth and detail, with all his trademark irrepressible humor and joy, in this new explorer's guide to what he calls \"the jungles of time and space\". Life on Earth probes the mysteries and magic of our reality, from past civilizations to modern times, with an eye to the immediate future, offering an insider's view of how we humans create our experience on Earth literally from the ground up, as Mike pulls back the curtain on:    What it means to say that \"thoughts become things\"  Religions, secret societies, and what the truth really is  How to make sense of natural disasters and manmade tragedies  How consciousness evolves as we discover first our power, then our divinity, and then our responsibilities to live deliberately and in harmony with our fellow co-creators  The ultimate goal of life on Earth (it's simpler than you think)    As one of the featured teachers in The Secret, Mike is an internationally recognized expert in the science of deliberate living and conscious creation, known for taking a rational approach to even the deepest mysteries.

If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.  But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it.

Well, it happened. In Tom Barren's 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed...because it wasn't necessary.  Except Tom just can't seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that's before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life, but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland.  But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and - maybe, just maybe - his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom's search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future - our future - is supposed to be.  All Our Wrong Todays is about the versions of ourselves that we shed and grow into over time. It is a story of friendship and family, of unexpected journeys and alternate paths, and of love in its multitude of forms. Filled with humor and heart, and saturated with insight and intelligence and a mind-bending talent for invention, this novel signals the arrival of a major talent.

When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: She must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.  Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace - the world's fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it's up to Tristan to find out why.  And so the Department of Diachronic Operations - D.O.D.O. - gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive...and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial - and treacherous - nature of the human heart.  Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson's work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland's storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible and take you to places - and times - beyond imagining.

Their men are being held prisoner in a horrific nightmare dimension, and the only way to reach them is through the radioactive ruins of a monster-infested war zone.  As if that wasn't bad enough, it's also the home base of the powerful creature behind the devastating attacks on the Last Dragon and Copper Lake. It turns out ancient gods of chaos really hate trespassers. But this god picked a fight with the wrong crew, and now MHI wants payback. Calling on their allies, a massive expedition is formed, and with the odds stacked against them, a legion of hunters goes to war.  It's D-Day at the City of Monsters.

Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value.

First we live. Then we die. And then...we get another try?   Ten thousand tries, to be exact. Ten thousand lives to \"get it right\". Answer all the big questions. Achieve wisdom. And become one with everything.  Milo has had 9,995 chances so far and has just five more lives to earn a place in the cosmic soul. If he doesn't make the cut, oblivion awaits. But all Milo really wants is to fall forever into the arms of Death. Or Suzie, as he calls her.  More than just Milo's lover throughout his countless layovers in the Afterlife, Suzie is literally his reason for living - as he dives into one new existence after another, praying for the day he'll never have to leave her side again.  But Reincarnation Blues is more than a great love story: Every journey from cradle to grave offers Milo more pieces of the great cosmic puzzle - if only he can piece them together in time to finally understand what it means to be part of something bigger than infinity. As darkly enchanting as the works of Neil Gaiman and as wisely hilarious as Kurt Vonnegut's, Michael Poore's Reincarnation Blues is the story of everything that makes life profound, beautiful, absurd, and heartbreaking.

Whether someone is trying to qualify for the Olympics, break ground in mathematical theory or craft an artistic masterpiece, many of the practices that lead to great success are the same. In Peak Performance, Brad Stulberg, a former McKinsey and Company consultant and journalist who covers health and the science of human performance, and Steve Magness, a performance scientist and coach of Olympic athletes, team up to demystify these practices and demonstrate how everyone can achieve their best.  The first book of its kind, Peak Performance combines the inspiring stories of top performers across a range of capabilities - from athletic, to intellectual, to artistic - with the latest scientific insights into the cognitive and neurochemical factors that drive performance in all domains. In doing so, Peak Performance uncovers new linkages that hold promise as performance enhancers but have been overlooked in our traditionally-siloed ways of thinking. The result is a life-changing book in which listeners will learn how to enhance their performance via myriad ways including: optimally alternating between periods of intense work and rest; developing and harnessing the power of a self-transcending purpose; and priming the body and mind for enhanced productivity.  In revealing the science of great performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success, and coaches listeners on how to use them. If you want to take your game to the next level, whatever \"your game\" may be, Peak Performance will teach you how. ","author":"Brad Stulberg","authors":["Brad Stulberg","Steve Magness"],"narratedBy":"Christopher Lane","publishedYear":2017,"releaseDate":"2017-06-06","publisher":"Rodale","pageCount":246,"bookLength":"6:34:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ssxrhLwCL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B071ZSYCXB"},{"id":"audible-Jerry_Merritt~A_Gift_of_Time~223","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A Gift of Time","description":"When Micajah Fenton discovers a crater in his front yard with a broken time glider in the bottom and a naked, virtual woman on his lawn, he delays his plans to kill himself.

Cannell to craft a whodunit with buddy-cop charm and suspects aplenty - most of them in someone else's body.\" (USA Today)  John Scalzi returns with Head On, the stand-alone follow-up to the New York Times best-selling and critically acclaimed Lock In. Chilling near-future SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural, Head On brings Scalzi's trademark snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports.  Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent's head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like this would be impossible. But all the players are \"threeps\", robot-like bodies controlled by people with Haden's Syndrome, so anything goes. No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real, and the crowds love it.  Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field.  Is it an accident or murder? FBI agents and Haden-related crime investigators Chris Shane and Leslie Vann are called in to uncover the truth - and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field.

No longer burdened by PTSD, he is free to enjoy his family and to help pick up the pieces of a pillaged world. At night, he trains with his eight-year-old companion, Bree, a.k.a.

But outside the hospital Crazy is faced with a world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, and finds himself relocated to Neuro Inc., a secretive corporation with strange government ties.

It’s held as a firm proposition in metaphysics, and some spiritual teachers ascribe infinite powers to the mind. But are these claims scientifically accurate? What does the scientific evidence tell us about the scope of the human mind to transform thoughts into reality?  New research and new discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, cymatics (the study of wave phenomena), public health, and quantum physics are demonstrating that thoughts can indeed be profoundly creative. In Mind to Matter, award-winning author Dawson Church examines the scientific facts and reviews the studies that show, step by step, exactly how our minds create material form. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, the science turns out to be even more astonishing than the metaphysics.  Throughout the book, Church shares illuminating case histories - up-close, authentic personal accounts of people who had experiences of turning mind into matter. Drawn from the worlds of medicine, sports, business, healing, art, and scientific discovery, these stories run the gamut from profound to inspiring to heart-wrenching. Meticulously researched evidence is presented in highly relatable form, using engaging, understandable, nontechnical analogies.  As we discover how the universe operates synchronistically, we come to understand that while we have individual local minds, we also participate in universal nonlocal mind. Mind to Matter shows us that as we take charge of our individual power to create, we have the potential, as a species, to catalyze a transformation of our whole world.","author":"Dawson Church","authors":["Dawson Church"],"narratedBy":"Dawson Church","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2019-08-06","publisher":"Hay House, Inc","pageCount":361,"bookLength":"10:48:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DVAz5iaUL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness","asin":"B07C4Z1Y5V"},{"id":"audible-Gary_John_Bishop~Unfu*k_Yourself~785","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Unfu*k Yourself","description":"New York Times best seller Joining the ranks of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, You Are a Badass, and F*ck Feelings is this refreshing, BS-free self-empowerment guide that offers an honest, no-nonsense, tough-love approach to help you move past self-imposed limitations.  Are you tired of feeling f*cked up?

Why do couples argue about the same issues over and over? Why do so many people lie awake at night, stricken with worry and anxiety? Why is it so difficult to come to terms with a loved one's death, even if it's after a long illness?  The answers to these questions - and the path to lasting change in your life - lie in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a well-tested collection of practical techniques for managing moods and modifying undesirable behaviors through self-awareness, critical analysis, and goal-oriented change. CBT illuminates the links between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and physical health and uses those connections to develop concrete plans for self-improvement. Built on a solid foundation of neurological and behavioral research, CBT is an approach almost anyone can use for promoting greater mental health and improving quality of life.  In 24 engaging half-hour lectures, you'll build a robust and effective self-improvement toolkit with the expert guidance of Professor Satterfield of the University of California, San Francisco. You will explore CBT's roots in Socratic and stoic philosophy, build a toolkit of CBT techniques, and hear about the latest research about its outcomes. Additionally this intriguing and practical course allows you to take on the role of medical student, physician, psychologist, and patient.  Throughout the course you'll explore issues that cause people to seek out therapy. In some cases you'll get to hear Dr. Satterfield working with a patient, and in others you'll be delving into research to find what causes issues and how CBT helps to resolve them.

When a company hires him to recover stolen property - a camera that can allegedly take pictures of the past - Stephen finds himself in an adventure crossing oceans and fighting terrorists. What he discovers may upend the foundation of three major world religions - and, perhaps, give him a vital clue into the true nature of his aspects.

But what would it look like to study the whole of history, from the big bang through the present day - and even into the remote future? How would looking at the full span of time change the way we perceive the universe, the earth, and our very existence?  These were the questions David Christian set out to answer when he created the field of \"Big History\", the most exciting new approach to understanding where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. In Origin Story, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we've come to know as \"history\". By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together - from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond. With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, Origin Story boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.","author":"David Christian","authors":["David Christian"],"narratedBy":"Jamie Jackson","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-05-22","publisher":"Little, Brown","pageCount":368,"bookLength":"12:23:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418mMd+k3tL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Astronomy & Space Science - Astronomy","History"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"B07BDRVYKF"},{"id":"audible-Billy_Crystal~Have_a_Nice_Day~110","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Have a Nice Day","description":"Have a Nice Day features a live multi-cast script reading captured over two evenings in October of 2018 at Audible’s Minetta Lane Theatre in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village.  Tony and Emmy Award-winner Billy Crystal leads an all-star cast including Oscar winner Kevin Kline (President David Murray) and four-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening (First Lady Katherine Murray) in a performance of this hilarious and poignant story about a man desperately scrambling to put his affairs in order: to save his presidency, his marriage, his relationship with his daughter - and possibly his life.  President David Murray starts the day in crisis.

It's perfectly normal to go through emotional crises or have periods when you feel panicked or out of sorts. It is how you respond to these challenges that will make all the difference in how you feel - not just immediately but also in the long run.

When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists toiling in unknown laboratories to business leaders changing the world to mediation masters discovering inner peace. His guests were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What made them so successful - and what made them tick? At the end of each interview, Dave asked the same question: “What are your top three recommendations for people who want to perform better at being human?” After performing a statistical analysis of the answers, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people could be distilled into three main objectives: finding ways to become smarter, faster, and happier. Game Changers is the culmination of Dave’s years-long immersion in these conversations, offering 46 science-backed, high performance “laws” that are a virtual playbook for how to get better at life. With anecdotes from game changers like Dr. Daniel Amen, Gabby Bernstein, Dr. David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Esther Perel, and Tim Ferris as well as examples from Dave’s own life, Game Changers offers listeners practical advice they can put into action to reap immediate rewards. From taming fear and anxiety to making better decisions, establishing high-performance habits, and practicing gratitude and mindfulness, Dave brings together the wisdom of today’s game-changers to help everyone kick more ass at life.

It is here, under the constant threat of exploding shells and artillery, that British and German soldiers live in deplorable conditions. Braving the merciless cold and crushing exhaustion and hunger, the men conduct patrols and fight, often to the death, to advance mere inches in the frozen No Man’s Land that lies between them. But on Christmas Eve, the Western Front gives way to a miracle of grace, as soldiers from both sides emerge from their trenches to greet each other, share their meager rations, and bury the dead for an unofficial and temporary truce. Drawing upon the unforgettable true story of history’s most transcendent ceasefire, this Audible Original, a finalist for the 2016 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, commemorates an astonishing moment of peace—and celebration of man’s capacity for kindness—in the midst of total war.

This past October, the iconic play was reimagined and produced by Audible for a limited run at Minetta Lane Theatre in Manhattan's West Village.  Recorded for an Audible-exclusive audience, listeners can forgo the price of admission and embark on the cross-cultural journey with Mandvi. Listen in as he seamlessly transitions from character to character, impersonating a teenage girl as she grapples with coming of age in New York under the roof of traditional Indian parents, and an older male restauranteur clinging to his heritage with the same remarkable ease.  Entertaining and intimate, this story of what it means to be an American was written long before immigration became an intensely polarizing issue. Today, it’s revival feels necessary if not urgent, and certainly as honest and refreshing as ever.  Written and performed by Aasif Mandvi.  Directed by Kimberly Senior.  Originally directed and developed by Kimberly Hughes.

Rather, an epic conspiracy is slowly coming to fruition. Thousands of years ago, beings infiltrated our society, bred with humans, then died—leaving an untraceable, inexplicable anomaly in our DNA. Now that genetic code has activated, and chaos has erupted. But private investigator Tom Lombard has his own chaos to face. His personal life is falling apart, and he just found his latest “missing person” dead in a dumpster. Suddenly he’s being chased by a woman with silver hair and two black-eyed goons with unnatural abilities. And what’s with all these people in masks—and the crazy girl ranting on the internet about the end of the world? Is humanity’s only hope a weird band of eccentrics and one down-on-his-luck, disgraced ex-cop badly in need of a win? In this wild, souped-up apocalyptic vision of Les Bohem—the acclaimed, Emmy Award-winning writer of the Steven Spielberg miniseries, Taken—the reckoning begins, culminating in something truly unexpected.

As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one’s actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment - how they were raised - or is there a genetic component to their lack of conscience?  This is the question Kiehl, a protégé of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was determined to answer as he began his career 20 years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psychopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than 500 psychopaths and 3,000 other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl’s laboratory - the world’s largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of The Psychopath Whisperer, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psychopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder.  In The Psychopath Whisperer, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psychopaths and studying their thought processes - from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and personality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy.  A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, The Psychopath Whisperer will open your eyes on a fascinating but little-understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.","author":"Kent A.

In Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses - to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back. In Stop Doing That Sh*t, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior.  Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way we’re wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we f--k ourselves over: We can’t save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We’re stuck in a rut at work. Analyzing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives.  Authored in the same in-your-face style as Unfu*k Yourself, Stop Doing That Sh*t will help us get in touch with our psychological machinery so we learn to interrupt negative thoughts and behavior before they start, allowing us to give our attention to something else, and start to find success in the areas we thought we never could.  We can take back our lives.

When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: She must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.  Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace - the world's fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it's up to Tristan to find out why.  And so the Department of Diachronic Operations - D.O.D.O. - gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive...and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial - and treacherous - nature of the human heart.  Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson's work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland's storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible and take you to places - and times - beyond imagining.

Quietly profound and touching.”—BoingBoing  From the author of The Postmortal, a fantasy saga unlike any you’ve read before, weaving elements of folk tales and video games into a riveting, unforgettable adventure of what a man will endure to return to his family When Ben, a suburban family man, takes a business trip to rural Pennsylvania, he decides to spend the afternoon before his dinner meeting on a short hike. Once he sets out into the woods behind his hotel, he quickly comes to realize that the path he has chosen cannot be given up easily. With no choice but to move forward, Ben finds himself falling deeper and deeper into a world of man-eating giants, bizarre demons, and colossal insects.  On a quest of epic, life-or-death proportions, Ben finds help comes in some of the most unexpected forms, including a profane crustacean and a variety of magical objects, tools, and potions. Desperate to return to his family, Ben is determined to track down the \"Producer,\" the creator of the world in which he is being held hostage and the only one who can free him from the path.  At once bitingly funny and emotionally absorbing, Magary’s novel is a remarkably unique addition to the contemporary fantasy genre, one that draws as easily from the world of classic folk tales as it does from video games. In The Hike, Magary takes readers on a daring odyssey away from our day-to-day grind and transports them into an enthralling world propelled by heart, imagination, and survival.","author":"Drew Magary","authors":["Drew Magary"],"narratedBy":"Christopher Lane","publishedYear":2016,"releaseDate":"2017-07-04","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":290,"bookLength":"8:04:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ODo8AOXDL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy - Paranormal & Urban - Paranormal","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality","asin":"B01HIJ8X36"},{"id":"audible-Pimsleur~Chinese_(Mandarin)_Level_1_Lessons_11-15~426","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Chinese (Mandarin) Level 1 Lessons 11-15","author":"Pimsleur","narratedBy":"Pimsleur","publishedYear":2010,"bookLength":"2:30:00","categories":["Education & Learning - Education"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","description":"Pimsleur® equals success.

It’s a place to live. And when you’re here, you’ll never want to leave. “On the surface, The Warehouse is a thrilling story of corporate espionage at the highest level, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a terrifying cautionary tale of the nightmare world we are making for ourselves.” (Blake Crouch, New York Times best-selling author of Dark Matter) Film rights sold to Imagine Entertainment for director Ron Howard!  Named One of the Best Books of the Year by Financial Times • Real Simple • Kirkus Reviews  Paxton never thought he’d be working for Cloud, the giant tech company that’s eaten much of the American economy. Much less that he’d be moving into one of the company’s sprawling live-work facilities. But compared to what’s left outside, Cloud’s bland chainstore life of gleaming entertainment halls, open-plan offices, and vast warehouses...well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s more than anyone else is offering.   Zinnia never thought she’d be infiltrating Cloud. But now she’s undercover, inside the walls, risking it all to ferret out the company’s darkest secrets. And Paxton, with his ordinary little hopes and fears? He just might make the perfect pawn. If she can bear to sacrifice him.  As the truth about Cloud unfolds, Zinnia must gamble everything on a desperate scheme - one that risks both their lives, even as it forces Paxton to question everything about the world he’s so carefully assembled here.  Together, they’ll learn just how far the company will go...to make the world a better place.  Set in the confines of a corporate panopticon that’s at once brilliantly imagined and terrifyingly real, The Warehouse is a near-future thriller about what happens when Big Brother meets Big Business - and who will pay the ultimate price.  Advance praise for The Warehouse “A fun, fast-paced read [that] walks a fine line between a near-future thriller and a smart satire...makes you wonder if we’re already too far into a disastrous future, or if there’s still some hope for humanity.” (NPR) “Holy hell, The Warehouse is our future, isn’t it? Imagine that one day we screw up the world and our country so damn bad that we all have to live where we work in what amounts to a modern variant on indentured servitude, and then layer on top of that a bleeding-edge thriller set inside a massively autocratic corporate entity, and you still haven’t seen just how sharp, or scary, this book is.... Taut, tense, and masterful.” (Chuck Wendig) “Wildly imaginative yet terrifyingly real, The Warehouse is both a gripping thriller and an alarming glimpse into what could soon be our future.” (Riley Sager, New York Times best-selling author of Lock Every Door)","author":"Rob Hart","authors":["Rob Hart"],"narratedBy":"Emily Woo Zeller ","publishedYear":2019,"releaseDate":"2020-08-25","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":370,"bookLength":"13:08:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51C4t0imtUL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Hard Science Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"SciFi","asin":"1984886924"},{"id":"audible-M._R._James~The_Conception_of_Terror:_Tales_Inspired_by_M._R._James_-_Volume_1~412","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Conception of Terror: Tales Inspired by M.

Casting the Runes - adapted by Stephen Gallagher When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - The Truth of Alchemy, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.    On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: 'In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.' Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse?  Lost Hearts - adapted by A. K. Benedict Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House. The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas - adapted by Jonathan Barnes When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it. A View from a Hill - adapted by Mark Morris Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill.","author":"M. R. James","authors":["M. R.

Not because of the 20 felonies she’d committed, or the nature of her crimes, or even that she’d been captain of the high school cheerleading squad just a few years earlier, but because her boyfriend was a Deputy Sherriff, and his friends - their friends - were the ones who’d arrested her.

Simply being human means experiencing emotional and physical pain. None of us escapes dealing with pain, failure, and setbacks, but learning how to practice mindful self-compassion can be life-changing. It comes from the understanding that every human being suffers, that we all want to be happy, and that this commonality connects us with everyone else. Over the last decade, there has been an international explosion of research on mindfulness. Contemplative practices are being integrated with science and psychology. Researchers are sharing information on the power of inner-directed compassion and its beneficial effects on mental well-being, growth, motivation, relationships, and physical health. Join expert Laurie Cameron to discover tools - including meditations, exercises, journaling, and in-the-moment practices - that will help you evoke mindfulness and empathy in your everyday life in a way that it becomes your natural response - your new set of habits. As you adopt these practices, you’ll start to see a shift in how you work with stressful life events, as well as how you connect with the shared human experience of loss, challenge, and disappointment. ","author":"Laurie J.

On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the \"steam\" that children with the \"shining\" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.  Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant \"shining\" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying.

A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver's enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 - \"Q\" is for \"question mark\". A world that bears a question.  Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.  As Aomame's and Tengo's narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.  A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell's, 1Q84 is Haruki Murakami's most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.

This magnificent novel has a similarly extraordinary scope and the same capacity to amaze, entertain, and bewitch. A tour de force of metaphysical reality, it is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle - yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.  Extravagant in its accomplishment, Kafka on the Shore displays one of the world's truly great storytellers at the height of his powers.","author":"Haruki Murakami","authors":["Haruki Murakami"],"narratedBy":"Sean Barrett ","publishedYear":2013,"releaseDate":"2006-01-03","publisher":"Vintage","pageCount":480,"bookLength":"19:08:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YcbO1nGUL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B00E83NFUC"},{"id":"audible-J._P._Pomare~Tell_Me_Lies~609","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Tell Me Lies","description":"Psychologist Margot Scott has a picture-perfect life: a nice house in the suburbs, a husband, two children and a successful career.   On a warm spring morning Margot approaches one of her clients on a busy train platform.

While not every story is concerned with the hard science behind space travel and other futuristic ventures, fiction can give us amazing insight into what we could be capable of and what we dream of doing.  In the 10 lectures of The Science of Sci-Fi: From Warp Speed to Interstellar Travel, Professor Erin Macdonald interweaves real science and the achievements of the imagination to reveal the truth that underlies our favorite stories and sheds light on what the future may hold. From faster-than-light travel to journeys through time itself, science fiction makes humanity seem limitless. So, what scientific boundaries are we pushing against as we seek to fly among the stars?  Beginning with an overview of the physics of time and space as we know them, Professor Macdonald shows how stories extrapolate current knowledge to create visions of the future and how likely - or unlikely - these fictional journeys could be. What would happen if a spaceship flew into a wormhole, as it does in the film Galaxy Quest? Or, if you prefer video games, what would happen if you fired a rocket launcher on the Moon like the soldiers of Mass Effect? Could we ever break the bounds of light speed as they do in Star Wars and move across the universe without spending decades trying to make it to a distant exoplanet? Is the transporter technology of Star Trek really possible?  As you look closely at artificial gravity, inertial dampeners, tachyons, red matter, time dilation, and other sci-fi mainstays through the theories of some of science’s greatest thinkers, you will find that your favorite science fiction stories become even more astonishing.","author":"The Great Courses","authors":["The Editors of LIFE"],"narratedBy":"Erin Macdonald","publishedYear":2019,"releaseDate":"2016-06-24","publisher":"Time Inc.

Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Carolina in My Mind\", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, \"the source of many of my songs\", and Break Shot is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going \"beyond the spoken word\", Break Shot combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn \"Jerusalem\", selections from his newest release American Standard, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for Break Shot and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist. Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, Sweet Baby James, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21. Journey with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts - and a beloved voice to millions.","author":"James Taylor","authors":["Joseph Smith Jr.","Brigham Young","James E.

Prepare yourself for a transformative experience. Sometimes, life’s setbacks contain hidden gifts. Here at Lakewood, you’ll find the space to unwrap them. A weekend at the Lakewood Retreat is exactly what Chloe Powell needs. Freshly unemployed after her boss loses a reelection campaign, the former press secretary desperately wants a break from the bustle of Washington, DC. A flier posted at her yoga studio leads her to the getaway, which looks amazing: Organic meals, celebrity testimonials, and a serene private property within driving distance of the city. It’s so perfect, in fact, that Chloe’s barely bothered by the intensely personal questions she’s asked in her application, or the unnerving social experiments her enigmatic host, Sebastian, imposes on her once she arrives at his remote cabin. But when a mysterious new guest shows up, Chloe can no longer suppress her rising panic: This place is not at all what it seems. A pulse-pounding story from the first minute to the last, The Getaway explores the weight of the small choices we make every day, and their staggering, unintended consequences.","author":"Greer Hendricks","authors":["Greer Hendricks","Sarah Pekkanen"],"narratedBy":"Emily Bauer","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2019-01-08","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","pageCount":382,"bookLength":"2:24:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519CF87x1aL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Suspense","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense","asin":"B089B7D9NP"},{"id":"audible-Andrew_Rowe~How_to_Defeat_a_Demon_King_in_Ten_Easy_Steps~29","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps","description":"For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King rises and conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat him. Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save. And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan. She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy. She might not be a Hero - but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.","author":"Andrew Rowe","authors":["Andrew Rowe"],"narratedBy":"Suzy Jackson ","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2020-10-28","pageCount":162,"bookLength":"5:28:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZyKoD7MLL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy - Epic"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B086R2N27Y"},{"id":"audible-J.K._Rowling~The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard~700","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Tales of Beedle the Bard","description":"\"The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense and ingenuity.\" As every fan of the Harry Potter stories knows, the shelves of the Hogwarts Library are home to all sorts of fascinating books.

Readers adore Stephen King’s novels, and his novellas are their own dark treat, briefer but just as impactful and enduring as his longer fiction. Many of his novellas have been made into iconic films, including The Body (Stand by Me) and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (Shawshank Redemption). Four brilliant new tales in If It Bleeds are sure to prove as iconic as their predecessors. Once again, King’s remarkable range is on full display. In the title story, fan-favorite Holly Gibney (from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and The Outsider) must face her fears and possibly another outsider - this time on her own. In Mr. Harrigan’s Phone an intergenerational friendship has a disturbing afterlife. The Life of Chuck explores, beautifully, how each of us contains multitudes. And in Rat, a struggling writer must contend with the darker side of ambition. If these novellas show King’s range, they also prove that certain themes endure. One of King’s great concerns is evil, and in If It Bleeds, there’s plenty of it. There is also evil’s opposite, which in King’s fiction often manifests as friendship. Holly is reminded that friendship is not only life-affirming but can be life-saving. Young Craig befriends Mr. Harrigan, and the sweetness of this late-in-life connection is its own reward. “Exactly what I wanted to read right now,” said Ruth Franklin in a rave on the cover of The New York Times Book Review. “Phenomenal,\" said Brian Truitt in USA Today. “King still owns the fright business like none other.” ","author":"Stephen King","authors":["Stephen King"],"narratedBy":"Will Patton ","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2020-04-21","publisher":"Scribner","pageCount":448,"bookLength":"15:12:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519Entb4D0L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Suspense","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense","asin":"1797104802"},{"id":"audible-Kevin_Hart~The_Decision~32","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Decision","description":"\"Are you ready to get your mind right and prepare for the battle of your life?\"  Superstar stand-up.

Like millions of her millennial peers, Rachel Held Evans didn't want to go to church anymore. The hypocrisy, the politics, the gargantuan building budgets, the scandals - Church culture seemed so far removed from Jesus. Yet despite her cynicism and misgivings, something kept drawing her back. And so she set out on a journey to understand the Church and to find her place in it.  Centered around seven sacraments, Evans' quest takes listeners through a liturgical year with stories about baptism, communion, confirmation, confession, marriage, vocation, and death that are funny, heartbreaking, and sharply honest.  A memoir about making do and taking risks, about the messiness of community and the power of grace, Searching for Sunday is about overcoming cynicism to find hope and, somewhere in between, Church.

A new novel in both verse and prose from number-one New York Times best-selling author Ellen Hopkins.  For as long as she can remember, it's been just Ariel and Dad. Ariel's mom disappeared when she was a baby. Dad says home is wherever the two of them are, but Ariel is now 17, and after years of new apartments, new schools, and new faces, all she wants is to put down some roots. Complicating things are Monica and Gabe, both of whom have stirred a different kind of desire.  Maya's a teenager who's run from an abusive mother right into the arms of an older man she thinks she can trust. But now she's isolated, with a baby on the way, and life's getting more complicated than Maya ever could have imagined.  Ariel and Maya's lives collide unexpectedly when Ariel's mother shows up out of the blue with wild accusations: Ariel wasn't abandoned. Her father kidnapped her 14 years ago.  What is Ariel supposed to believe? Is it possible Dad's woven her entire history into a tapestry of lies? How can she choose between the mother she's been taught to mistrust and the father who has taken care of her all these years?  In best-selling author Ellen Hopkins' deft hands, Ariel's emotionally charged journey to find out the truth of who she really is balances beautifully with Maya's story of loss and redemption. This is a memorable portrait of two young women trying to make sense of their lives and coming face to face with themselves - for both the last and the very first time.

While some see the coming collapse as the end, others see opportunity.  Fleeing Naples after rival crime lords decimated his family, Don Antonio Moretti settles in Los Angeles to rebuild his criminal empire.

Emma Gable, a blind teenager coming of age in a small industrial town in Western New York, is about as far from the seismic cultural transformations rocking campuses and city streets across America as a person can get. Emma escapes the chaos of her dysfunctional family by dialing up random numbers on the phone in her bedroom, just to see who'll answer. But when a fateful call connects her to a mysterious band of proto-hackers calling themselves \"Phone Phreaks\", the revolution comes home, changing Emma's life for good. Because, Bell Telephone, the world's biggest corporation, is not amused that a handful of teenagers suddenly have the power to seize control of its vast and lucrative network and bend it to their will. Bringing down the Phreaks is the corporate Goliath's number one priority, but for Bell Security agent Bill Connolly, the crusade becomes personal as he struggles to outwit and outmaneuver an adversary that seems always one step ahead of him. Phreaks is the story of a fracturing family struggling to redefine itself as the world changes rapidly around it. Set at the dawn of the information age, its characters struggle with the same issues that define us today: privacy and surveillance, misuse of personal data, the ownership of ideas, our century-long obsession with the telephone, and the thirst for community that's driven us, since the dawn of time, to seek out new ways to \"reach out and touch someone\".

Tyler Shultz had been in the workforce for less than a year when he emailed Elizabeth Holmes, his employer and the CEO and founder of Theranos, with concerns that the company’s lab practices were faulty, ignored quality control, and were potentially dangerous to patients. The COO fired back with a dismissive and insulting email, to which Tyler replied: “Consider this my two weeks’ notice.” From there, his life spun out of control at the hand of Elizabeth, her team of high-powered lawyers, and the patriarch of Tyler’s own family George Shultz - one of America’s most prominent statesmen - who sat among the top of the Theranos board of directors. And yet, Tyler forged on. To protect his own conscience, the honor and reputation of his grandfather, and the health of patients worldwide.

Unable to deny the arguments but not wanting to deny his family, Qureshi struggled with an inner turmoil that will challenge Christians, Muslims, and all those who are interested in two of the world's greatest religions and the quest for truth. Qureshi - with great courage and intimacy - wrote this book with three major purposes in mind:   To tear down walls between two of the world's major religions by giving non-Muslim listeners an insider's perspective into a Muslim's heart and mind. To equip the listener with facts and knowledge, showing the strength of the case for the gospel contrasted with the case for Islam. To portray the immense inner struggle of Muslims grappling with the gospel, including all the sacrifices and doubts that rise up along the way.  Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus is more than the memoir of a man's pursuit of answers to the most important issues of life and faith. Ultimately, it's the story about the transformative grace and mercy of the one true God.

Activist author Marissa LaRocca’s revelatory tale includes her struggle with her secrets, including sexuality, and how she emerged as an outspoken advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues. Many young women and girls struggle with the body image issues that engender eating disorders with elaborate rituals around food, binging, purging, and hiding it all while trying to maintain a face of normalcy to the world. Anorexia and bulimia have become major national health crises, with skyrocketing statistics indicating that between 3 and 5 percent of the population suffer anorexia nervosa alone. Sadly, many never attain the sense of being “normal” and deal with a lifetime of body image and self-esteem issues. This intimate account of courage and the search for truth and meaning will have you rooting for Marissa LaRocca as she unravels the emotional layers of her own battle with food, body image, and sexuality. Readers of this riveting memoir will relate to the coming-of-age story of a young woman confronting some of life’s major issues while living, for a time, in two closets: one to hide her eating disorder and one to hide her sexuality and very identity. Echoes of Portia de Rossi’s Unbearable Lightness resound in LaRocca’s portrait of a life seemingly lived out in the open but, in truth, very much concealed.  Through her inspiring triumphs and revelations, activist and author Marissa LaRocca invites readers to confront themselves. She asks, “What if, at the root of all ‘disorders’, is the refusal to acknowledge or permit certain feelings - feelings that, if witnessed, have the power to free their sufferers? To what extent are ‘disorders’ actually doorways to helping us understand the truth about our lives?” In addition to her personal story, LaRocca takes a close look at society’s role in the development of eating disorders and other mental health challenges, establishing that the prevalence of such “illnesses” represent a collective yearning for connection, acceptance, and emotional nourishment among generations that are starving for so many things. Starving in Search of Me resolves with hope and an abundance of insights, tools, and resources to support eating disorder sufferers and members of the LGBTQ community alike. It’s a head-on journey toward total self-acceptance that will nourish the spirit and inspire readers to embrace their differences and nurture their authentic selves.","author":"Marissa LaRocca","authors":[" Marissa LaRocca"],"narratedBy":"Emily Woo Zeller","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-02-13","publisher":"Mango Media Inc.","pageCount":214,"bookLength":"3:53:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UuIVCP3wL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"B079BZFGRM"},{"id":"audible-Nic_Sheff~Tweak~11","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Tweak","description":"Nic Sheff was drunk for the first time at age 11.

But when Jake leaves \"The Girlfriend\" stranded at an abandoned high school, what follows is a twisted unraveling of the darkest unease, an exploration into psychological frailty, and an ending as suspenseful as The Usual Suspects and as haunting as Misery.  Deeply scary and intensely unnerving, Iain Reid's debut novel is a tightening spiral of a story about a woman's uncertainty of her relationship with her boyfriend, Jake. After an uncomfortable and confusing trip to meet Jake's parents at their isolated farmhouse, reality unravels, and events spin out of control when Jake and \"The Girlfriend\" make an unscheduled stop at an abandoned high school.  Part murder mystery, part psychological thriller, I'm Thinking of Ending Things is about doubt, psychological fragility, and the lengths we'll go to avoid the truth. As twisted as Shutter Island, as suspenseful as Under the Skin, and as atmospheric as The Sisters Brothers, Reid's breakout literary thriller is sure to keep listeners guessing until the last minute.

Despite this brutal logic, some species have learned to survive in even the most hostile conditions. Others couldn't - and perished. While incremental genetic adaptations hone the physiology of nearly every creature on this planet, there's another evolutionary force that is just as important: the power of choice. In this explosive investigation into the limits of endurance, journalist Scott Carney discovers how humans can wedge control over automatic physiological responses into the breaking point between stress and biology. We can reclaim our evolutionary destiny. In his New York Times best seller, What Doesn't Kill Us, Carney submerged himself in ice water and learned breathing techniques from daredevil fitness guru Wim Hof. It gave him superhuman levels of endurance and quieted a persistent autoimmune illness. At the core of those methods is a technique called The Wedge that can give a person an edge in just about any situation. In this thrilling exploration of the limits and potential of the human body, Carney searches the globe for people who understand the subtle language of how the body responds to its environment. He confronts fear at a cutting-edge neuroscience laboratory at Stanford, and learns about flow states by tossing heavy weights with partners. He meets masters of mental misdirection in the heat of a Latvian sauna, experiments with breathing routines that bring him to the cusp of transcendence, searches his mind in sensory deprivation tanks, and ultimately ends up in the Amazon jungle with a shaman who promises either madness or universal truth.

Only one man was allowed to record extensive interviews with the shooter. This is what he found.  On July 20, 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, a man in dark body armor and a gas mask entered a midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises with a tactical shotgun, a high-capacity assault rifle, and a sidearm. He threw a canister of tear gas into the crowd and began firing. Soon twelve were dead and fifty-eight were wounded; young children and pregnant women were among them. The man was found calmly waiting at his car. He was detained without resistance. Unlike the Columbine, Newtown, San Bernadino, and Parkland shootings, James Holmes is unique among mass shooters in his willingness to be taken into custody alive. In the court case that followed, only Dr. William H. Reid, a distinguished forensic psychiatrist, would be allowed to record interviews with the defendant. Reid would read Holmes’ diary, investigate his phone calls and text messages, interview his family and acquaintances, speak to his victims, and review tens of thousands of pages of evidence and court testimony in an attempt to understand how a happy, seemingly normal child could become a killer. A Dark Night in Aurora uses the twenty-three hours of unredacted interview transcripts never seen by the public and Reid’s research to bring the listener inside the mind of a mass murderer. The result is chilling, gripping study of abnormal psychology and how a lovely boy named Jimmy became a killer.","author":"William H. Reid MD MPH","authors":["Dr. William H.

Soon to be a major motion picture “[Picoult] offers a thought-provoking examination of racism in America today, both overt and subtle. Her many readers will find much to discuss in the pages of this topical, moving book.” (Booklist [starred review]) Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than 20 years’ experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she’s been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don’t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?  Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy’s counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family - especially her teenage son - as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other’s trust, and come to see that what they’ve been taught their whole lives about others - and themselves - might be wrong.  With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion - and doesn’t offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game. Praise for Small Great Things “Small Great Things is the most important novel Jodi Picoult has ever written.... It will challenge her readers...[and] expand our cultural conversation about race and prejudice.” (The Washington Post) “A novel that puts its finger on the very pulse of the nation that we live in today...a fantastic read from beginning to end, as can always be expected from Picoult, this novel maintains a steady, page-turning pace that makes it hard for readers to put down.” (San Francisco Book Review)","author":"Jodi Picoult","authors":["Jodi Picoult"],"narratedBy":"Ari Fliakos ","publishedYear":2016,"releaseDate":"2016-10-11","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":528,"bookLength":"16:14:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zTG3Kr1gL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B01JKDTP26"},{"id":"audible-Faith_G._Harper_PhD_LPC-S_ACS_ACN~Unf*ck_Your_Adulting~564","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Unf*ck Your Adulting","description":"Making maturity fun again!

Soon after he opened his vineyard for business many years ago, the Wealthy Gardener noticed a puzzling fact. Everyone wanted money, but only a few people managed to accumulate it. The reason, he realized, is that most people focus on short-term gains instead of achieving lasting wealth.  As he grew old and aware of his dwindling time on this Earth, the Wealthy Gardener began to share his hard-earned wisdom with the financially troubled in his community, patiently mentoring those who asked for his practical advice on the ways of prosperity.  The parable of the Wealthy Gardener is far more than an admonishment to earn more or spend less; it is about timeless principles. As his lessons reveal, financial freedom is a means to power and control over our lives. Without money, we are subject to the demands and whims of others. With money, we are sheltered from the storm, and we can extend that shelter to our loved ones. Poised to become an intimate financial classic, The Wealthy Gardener will inspire listeners to find their own noble purpose and relieve their money worries once and for all. No matter your income level, skillset, or unique economic disadvantages, the lessons in this book will show you the path forward. All you need is the will to work, the desire to succeed, and the motivation to learn.","author":"John Soforic","authors":["John Soforic"],"narratedBy":"Dennis Kleinman","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2020-02-25","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":434,"bookLength":"12:56:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41hIB9um-ZL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity","asin":"0593286383"},{"id":"audible-Anyen_Rinpoche~The_Tibetan_Yoga_of_Breath~601","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Tibetan Yoga of Breath","description":"Modern science and classic spiritual traditions agree: regulating the breath leads to radiance and wellness of body, mind, and spirit.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.  Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.  Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.  This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?

A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you won't want to leave. Later, you'll find that you can't. Every nine years, the house's residents - an odd brother and sister - extend a unique invitation to someone who's different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student.

These days, an increasing number of scientific researchersare turning their studies to people who have experienced what the author callsdeath travels - putting stock and credence in the sights, encounters, andexciting experiences reported by those who return from the dead.

A decade ago, the company announced that they had found the gene that pairs each of us with our soul mate. Since then, millions of people around the world have been matched.

Do you suffer from crippling shyness, obsessive doubts, or feelings of insecurity? Are you plagued by fears, phobias, or panic attacks?  What you may not realize is that these fears are almost never based on reality. Anxiety is one of the world's oldest cons. When you're anxious, you're actually fooling yourself. You are telling yourself things that simply aren't true. See if you can recognize yourself in any of these distortions:    All-or-Nothing Thinking: \"My mind will go blank when I give my presentation at work, and everyone will think I'm an idiot.\"  Fortune Telling: \"I just know I'll freeze up and blow it when I take my test.\"  Mind Reading: \"Everyone at this party can see how nervous I am.\"  Magnification: \"Flying is so dangerous. I think this plane is going to crash!\"  Should Statements: \"I shouldn't be so anxious and insecure. Other people don't feel this way.\"  Emotional Reasoning: \"I feel like I'm on the verge of cracking up!\" Self-Blame: \"What's wrong with me? I'm such a loser!\" Mental Filter: \"Why can't I get anything done? My life seems like one long procrastination.\"  Now imagine what it would be like to live a life that's free of worries and self-doubt; to go to sleep at night feeling peaceful and relaxed; to overcome your shyness and have fun with other people; to give dynamic presentations without worrying yourself sick ahead of time; to enjoy greater creativity, productivity and self-confidence. Does that sound impossible? The truth is you can defeat your fears. In When Panic Attacks, Dr. Burns takes you by the hand and shows you how to overcome every conceivable kind of anxiety. In fact you will learn how to use more than 40 simple, effective techniques, and the moment you put the lie to the distorted thoughts that plague you, your fears will immediately disappear. Dr. Burns also shares the latest research on the drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety and depression and explains why they may sometimes do more harm than good. This is not pop psychology but proven, fast-acting techniques that have been shown to be more effective than medications. When Panic Attacks is an indispensable handbook for anyone who's worried sick and sick of worrying.

Accompanied by Delirium (Kristen Schaal, Bob’s Burgers), he tracks down their estranged brother, Destruction (David Harewood, Supergirl), the only member of the Endless ever to abandon their post. And at an inn at the intersection of all worlds, a group of travelers are forced together by a storm that threatens to destroy reality itself, with grave repercussions for Morpheus and the rest of the Endless. All the original cast returns, including Kat Dennings as Death, Aidan Turner as Cluracan, and Neil Gaiman himself as The Narrator, joined by Harewood and other new cast members Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), KJ Apa (Riverdale), Shruti Haasan (Race Gurram), and more.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger.  Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much-celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun.  Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor - of crystal pillars and fossil seas - where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn - first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars...and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race.  Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a classic work of 20th-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision and his heart - starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.","author":"Ray Bradbury","authors":["Ray Bradbury"],"narratedBy":"Mark Boyett","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2012-04-17","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","pageCount":260,"bookLength":"7:43:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lgtSDGorL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Classics","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction","asin":"B00M4LR286"},{"id":"audible-Jesse_Coomer~A_Practical_Guide_to_Breathwork~459","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A Practical Guide to Breathwork","description":"You have been breathing your whole life; now, learn how to breathe better to positively influence your mental and physical well-being.

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.” So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far.

Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It’s a love letter. To life. It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green, too.

In Albom's most sweeping novel yet, the voice of Music narrates the tale of its most beloved disciple, young Frankie Presto, a war orphan raised by a blind music teacher in a small Spanish town. At nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat. His only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings.  But Frankie's talent is touched by the gods, and his amazing journey weaves him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll, with his stunning talent affecting numerous stars along the way, including Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Wynton Marsalis, and even KISS.  Frankie becomes a pop star himself. He makes records. He is adored. But his gift is also his burden, as he realizes that through his music he can actually affect people's futures - with one string turning blue whenever a life is altered.  At the height of his popularity, Frankie Presto vanishes. His legend grows. Only decades later does he reappear - just before his spectacular death - to change one last life.

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.  While bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the listener on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the listener with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied the collapse of a civilization.  With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments - a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.  Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. ","author":"Saifedean Ammous","authors":["Saifedean Ammous"],"narratedBy":"James Fouhey","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-03-23","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","pageCount":304,"bookLength":"11:16:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bXwP-iB4L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Money & Finance - Personal Finance","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth","asin":"B07D7ZRKLJ"},{"id":"audible-Dave_Eggers~The_Every~240","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Every","description":"From the award-winning, best-selling author of The Circle comes an exciting new follow-up. When the world’s largest search engine/social media company, the Circle, merges with the planet’s dominant ecommerce site, it creates the richest and most dangerous - and, oddly enough, most beloved - monopoly ever known: the Every.

There are few tomes that coherently map such broad economic histories as well as Mr. Dalio’s. Perhaps more unusually, Mr. Dalio has managed to identify metrics from that history that can be applied to understand today.” (Andrew Ross Sorkin, New York Times) From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the number-one New York Times best seller Principles, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes - and to offer practical advice on how to navigate them well.  A few years ago, Ray Dalio noticed a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn’t encountered before. They included huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to the massive printing of money in the world’s three major reserve currencies; big political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than 100 years; and the rising of a world power (China) to challenge the existing world power (US) and the existing world order. The last time that this confluence occurred was between 1930 and 1945. This realization sent Dalio on a search for the repeating patterns and cause/effect relationships underlying all major changes in wealth and power over the last 500 years.  In this remarkable and timely addition to his Principles series, Dalio brings listeners along for his study of the major empires - including the Dutch, the British, and the American - putting into perspective the “Big Cycle” that has driven the successes and failures of all the world’s major countries throughout history. He reveals the timeless and universal forces behind these shifts and uses them to look into the future, offering practical principles for positioning oneself for what’s ahead.","author":"Ray Dalio","authors":["Ray Dalio"],"narratedBy":"Jeremy Bobb ","publishedYear":2021,"releaseDate":"2021-11-30","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","pageCount":594,"bookLength":"16:48:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WQsvi-90L._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Money & Finance - Economics - Economic History","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"1797115782"},{"id":"audible-Luke_Burgis~Wanting~291","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Wanting","description":"A groundbreaking exploration of why we want what we want, and a toolkit for freeing ourselves from chasing unfulfilling desires. Gravity affects every aspect of our physical being, but there’s a psychological force just as powerful - yet almost nobody has heard of it. It’s responsible for bringing groups of people together and pulling them apart, making certain goals attractive to some and not to others, and fueling cycles of anxiety and conflict. In Wanting, Luke Burgis draws on the work of French polymath René Girard to bring this hidden force to light and reveals how it shapes our lives and societies.   According to Girard, humans don’t desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic - we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare’s plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected. Wanting also shows that conflict does not arise because of our differences - it comes from our sameness. Because we learn to want what other people want, we often end up competing for the same things. Ignoring our large similarities, we cling to our perceived differences. Drawing on his experience as an entrepreneur, teacher, and student of classical philosophy and theology, Burgis shares tactics that help turn blind wanting into intentional wanting - not by trying to rid ourselves of desire, but by desiring differently. It’s possible to be more in control of the things we want, to achieve more independence from trends and bubbles, and to find more meaning in our work and lives. The future will be shaped by our desires. Wanting shows us how to desire a better one.

Nothing’s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their “flights” to the past. Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion—and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls. None of that compares to the corpse in room 526.

On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology—and the world’s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims. January is sure the timing isn’t a coincidence. Neither are those “accidents” that start stalking their bidders. There’s a reason January can glimpse what others can’t. A reason why she’s the only one who can catch a killer who’s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once.

Fast-forward 60 years and we’re still stuck in traffic in gas-guzzling sedans and boarding the same types of planes we flew in over half a century ago. What happened to the future we were promised? In Where Is My Flying Car?, J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer this deceptively simple question. What starts as an examination of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an investigation of the scientific, technological, and social roots of the economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion technology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress - one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. Drawing on years of original research and personal engineering experience, Where Is My Flying Car?, originally published in 2018, is an urgent, timely analysis of technological progress over the last 50 years and a bold vision for a better future.","author":"J.

In Victorian London, two children with mysterious powers are hunted by a figure of darkness—a man made of smoke. Sixteen-year-old Charlie Ovid, despite a brutal childhood in Mississippi, doesn't have a scar on him. His body heals itself, whether he wants it to or not. Marlowe, a foundling from a railway freight car, shines with a strange bluish light. He can melt or mend flesh.

There, the world of the dead and the world of the living threaten to collide. And as secrets within the Institute unfurl, Marlowe, Charlie and the rest of the Talents will discover the truth about their abilities, and the nature of what is stalking them: that the worst monsters sometimes come bearing the sweetest gifts.

Regarded as the Mt. Everest of haunted houses, its shadowed walls have witnessed scenes of unimaginable horror and depravity. All previous attempts to probe its mysteries have ended in murder, suicide, or insanity. But now, a new investigation has been launched, bringing four strangers to Belasco House in search of the ultimate secrets of life and death. A wealthy publisher, brooding over his impending death, has paid a physicist and two mediums to establish the facts of life after death once and for all. For one night, they will investigate the Belasco House and learn exactly why the townsfolk refer to it as the Hell House.

He just feels a little . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep. But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways. The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy. Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost. Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.

Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful - possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.  But we have one advantage: We get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?

This time, Ammous delves into the world's earlier shift from the gold standard to today's system of government-backed fiat money—outlining the fiat standard's purposes and failures; deriving the wider economic, political, and social implications of its use; and examining how bitcoin will affect it over time. With penetrating insight, Ammous analyzes global political currencies by analogy to bitcoin: how they're \"mined\" whenever government-guaranteed entities create loans, their lack of inherent restraints on inflation, and the rampant government intervention that has resulted in heavy, devastating, and persistent distortions to global markets for food, fuel, science, and education. Through these comparisons, Ammous demonstrates that bitcoin could be our next step forward—providing high salability across space, just like the fiat system, but without the unchecked fiat-denominated debt. Rather than a messy hyperinflationary collapse, the rise of bitcoin could look like a debt jubilee and an orderly upgrade to the world's monetary operating system, revolutionizing global capital and energy markets.","author":"Saifedean Ammous","authors":["Saifedean Ammous"],"narratedBy":"Saifedean Ammous ","publishedYear":2022,"releaseDate":"2021-11-16","publisher":"Saif House","pageCount":382,"bookLength":"12:44:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Rbtmu08UL._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Money & Finance - Economics - Macroeconomics","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education","asin":"B09VVCK4RY"},{"id":"audible-Sally_Hepworth~Uncharted_Waters~609","fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Uncharted Waters","author":"Sally Hepworth","narratedBy":"Candice Moll","publishedYear":2022,"bookLength":"1:44:00","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Suspense"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense","description":"“Speak your truth.” An icebreaker leads to unintended consequences for two strangers aboard a luxury yacht in this seductively twisty short story by the New York Times bestselling author of The Good Sister.

They were followed on their quest by the shepherds: friends and family who gave up everything to protect them. Their secret destination: Ouray, a small town in Colorado that would become one of the last outposts of civilization. Because the sleepwalking epidemic was only the first in a chain of events that led to the end of the world—and the birth of a new one. The survivors, sleepwalkers and shepherds alike, have a dream of rebuilding human society. Among them are Benji, the scientist struggling through grief to lead the town; Marcy, the former police officer who wants only to look after the people she loves; and Shana, the teenage girl who became the first shepherd—and an unlikely hero whose courage will be needed again. Because the people of Ouray are not the only survivors, and the world they are building is fragile. The forces of cruelty and brutality are amassing under the leadership of self-proclaimed president Ed Creel. And in the very heart of Ouray, the most powerful survivor of all is plotting its own vision for the new world: Black Swan, the AI who imagined the apocalypse. Against these threats, Benji, Marcy, Shana, and the rest have only one hope: one another. Because the only way to survive the end of the world is together.","author":"Chuck Wendig","authors":["Chuck Wendig"],"narratedBy":"Dominic Hoffman ","publishedYear":2022,"releaseDate":"2022-11-15","publisher":"Del Rey","pageCount":1002,"bookLength":"34:27:00","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ug9j9M6ML._SL500_.jpg","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Suspense","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense","asin":"B09M2Q7L7R"}]
